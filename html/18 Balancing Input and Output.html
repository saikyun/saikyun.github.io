<p>I watched a video about art one time, making art, that is. As I remember it, the video person said that one problem people can have is that they are doubting themselves. And one reason for that doubt is that they know a lot, but can only execute a little. This can happen when you watch a lot of tutorials on &quot;how to do things&quot; (like art), but don't spend enough time experimenting with the information you gathered. This builds up a huge discrepancy between what you know, and what you can do.</p>
<p>The video person gave a concrete ratio, I can't quite remember, but it was something like watching 20 minutes of art tutorials should be enough for at least 5 hours of practise, or maybe it was 20 hours.</p>
<p>I wonder, with tech, if the ratio isn't even worse. People are still debating SOLID principles, while I still feel pretty undecided about it. I haven't put in enough hours coding using those principles, or without, and compared them, to actually have a solid opinion. And I feel this way about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fibers</li>
<li>Macros (though I'm leaning pretty far into liking them, I have no clue about reader macros!?)</li>
<li>Logic in configuration files (though I think it's heresy, I can't really say why in a way that would convince anyone)</li>
<li>Exceptions</li>
<li>&quot;Functional programming&quot; (I can't even define it -- I'm pretty sure I like <code>map</code>/<code>filter</code>/<code>reduce</code> though, but I'm pretty sure I don't like allocating functions each time they are run)</li>
<li>forâ€“loops</li>
<li>Iterators</li>
</ul>
<p>And this is just basic stuff. How about which way to structure your code? What language to choose? Static vs dynamic typing? (You aren't allowed to have an opinion on this unless you've tried Idris.)</p>
<p>Okay, so, yeah. Whatever. This technical stuff is kinda getting in the way of the point I want to make. Which is this.</p>
<p>I think it's good to find a balance between input and output. If I have too much input, I'll just become an armchair expert, and those don't get anything done and everyone think they're annoying.</p>
<p>I've become more aware of this problem while trying to use the GTD tools. Like capturing all ideas and potential tasks. Now I try to listen to a podcast episode, or watch a talk. But just the amount of things I write down gets exhausting. There are so many good ideas in the world, and so much to explore. But I already have a ton of things to do and explore! I don't really need more ideas at the moment! I just need to output more. And in the meantime, I'll try to find more meaningless ways to rest, less draining than watching talks or listening to podcasts where my brain just fills up with more stuff I don't have time to try.</p>
