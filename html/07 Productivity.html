<h1 id="productivity"><a href="#productivity">Productivity</a></h1>
<p>I wanted to name this Tired, but I already made that post, so let's do something else.</p>
<p>During the weekend, I listened to 90% of the second episode of <a href="https://synk.fm/podcast/2-en-snurra-varje-dag/">Synk</a>. In this episode, Fredrik and Martin talks about productivity and productivity tools (like papers and pens and Obsidian). I don't care about productivity, I just wanted to listen to them talk about something that isn't game development, because I've spent the last 5 years of my life listening to game development podcasts.</p>
<p>One of the things I like about Fredrik is that he tends to question things. So when he said he didn't necessarily do Orthodox GTD, but still enjoyed <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gtd/comments/b6ok53/gtd_fast_not_sure_how_long_it_will_be_up_for/">these seminars by the author of the GTD book</a>, I was intrigued. I want to listen to people talk, and here's a person I like hearing talk saying I should listen to this other person talk. So I did.</p>
<p>First, the speaker (David Allen), feels very chill. I thought he'd be a stuffy business person, something I felt when trying to listen to Eat That Frog (some other productivity book thing). So it's just enjoyable to listen to him.</p>
<p>Secondly, his focus on being lazy, and that you should be able to enjoy all of life, not just work, made me feel that maybe he has something sensible to say.</p>
<p>So I kept listening for a bit while jog/walk/jogging today (maybe half an hour), and I'm still feeling &quot;nah, I don't need this productivity stuff, my memory is doing all right. the important things are always in front of me&quot;. But with his comment about &quot;collecting notes&quot; still ringing in my ears, I start noticing all the little problems at home that I have some intention to solve, and have not solved. Here's a sample:</p>
<ul>
<li>Out of milk</li>
<li>Three bottles of lotion of which two are almost empty</li>
<li>I have no job</li>
<li>Three bags of cardboard that needs to be recycled</li>
<li>A pot of potato soup has been on the balcony since february</li>
<li>A horde of bath toys next to the shower that are never used</li>
<li>Plan for working on my son's daycare tomorrow (e.g. eat lunch in time (which means buying lunch in time), bring something gluten free to eat between lunch and dinner (which means buying something gluten free))</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, all of these things are in front of me from time to time. But I don't keep them in mind for when I have time to deal with them. This is obvious stuff, but I have felt so anxious about having todo lists that I don't have time or energy to go through, that I've convinced myself the best solution is to have no list at all. But I'm starting to come around to the thought that I might be wrong. Maybe it's better to have the lists, and even if I haven't solved everything, at least I can think: &quot;well, it's on the list, and when I have time and energy, I can go through the list and solve it.&quot;</p>
<p>I don't need to keep it in my mind.</p>
