<p>It's hard for me how to know how to spend my time.</p>
<p>Sometimes I feel like I spend too little time with my son. At the same time, I think it can be hard to get all the things done while also getting time to spend with my son. And even if I get time to spend with my son, it can feel hard to find time to spend with my wife. And if I get both of those, it's hard to find time to spend with my wife and son at the same time. And then someone get's sick while we're at the playground. And now we have even less time to go buy food. So they eat leftovers, and I boil some rice. But now it's the day after that day, and now I have to buy breakfast before I can eat breakfast, and now I get less time to spend with my son.</p>
<p>Also I spent two hours watching this fascinating lecture about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ge3aKEmZcqY">performance in programming</a>.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
