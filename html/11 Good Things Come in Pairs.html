<p>Yesterday was an interesting day. After a bit of a struggle finding a nice place to work, I suddenly got two offers on the same day! One working with a game made in cljs + react native, which is kinda silly how good of a fit it is for me. However, the other offer was more stable, paid more (i.e. allowing me to work less, 15h/week(!!!)), and feels very meaningful.</p>
<p>So I chose the latter.</p>
<p>I think it's funny how common it is for me that when I struggle with something, and try to find a way out, it is often the case that after a time of panic, two solutions arise at the same time. It has happened multiple times with both love interests and jobs. Maybe it's a way to ensure that you suffer a bit as well, even in your time of luck? :)</p>
<p>I feel a bit bad for the cljs guy though, so if you are or know of someone interested in cljs + react native + gamedev, please contact me.</p>
<p>I'm very grateful that things seem to be turning out smoothly. Now I'll be in a good shape both economically and stress-wise (15h / w!!!) to receive our second son in august. ^_^</p>
