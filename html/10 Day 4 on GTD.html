<p>Since starting to note everything down, as per Orthodox GTD Dogma, I'm realizing I have way more obligations than I realized. In a single day I noted over 20 things for my inbox plus email plus texts. And I don't even have a job!</p>
<p>A sample of things in my inbox:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dinosaurs (for the RPG session I'm planning for my son &amp; wife, we recently made character for the <a href="https://handbokforsuperhjaltar.se/butik/spel/rollspel/handbok-for-superhjaltar-rollspelet/">Handbok för Superhjältar</a> role playing game)</li>
<li>Check Twitter</li>
<li>Remove rug from balcony</li>
<li>Contact son's friend's mom to plan playdate</li>
<li>Brett Victor, Future of Code and Learning Programming</li>
<li>Sun lamp</li>
<li>Check SMS from my wife (I accidentally read it but I need to remember to put it in my inbox)</li>
<li>Get Megaman Legends for a let's play that I'm doing with two friends</li>
</ul>
<p>It's just a lot of stuff!!</p>
<p>And I have even more already that has undergone the holy ritual of &quot;processing&quot;, which means they are deciphered into &quot;Goal&quot; and &quot;Action&quot;, and are under categories such as &quot;At Home&quot; or &quot;By Computer&quot; or &quot;Projects&quot;.</p>
<p>Oh great, I just found another note. 10 more things, so 30 for today.</p>
<p>I'm a bit happy to get all these obligations down on paper, but I also notice I feel stress that it takes so much time to just process all of these notes. I hope I'll reach a point when there won't be too much new stuff, and I can spend a bit more time actually doing some of the actions I've written down.</p>
<p>What are your experiences with GTD or similar systems?</p>
