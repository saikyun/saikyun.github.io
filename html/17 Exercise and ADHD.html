<p>I wonder how much less people with ADHD would suffer if they got sufficient exercise.</p>
<p>I feel both anxiety and sleeplessness decrease when I exercise.</p>
<p>I read that when children get to exercise that got their hearts going as little as 5 minutes in the morning, before classes, they were better at focusing.</p>
<p>I wonder how many get medicated when maybe they should just get a chance to exercise more.</p>
<p>I'm sure some people need medication, I just wonder if there are enough economic interests in getting people to move around more.</p>
<p>My back pain is eradicated after I jog/walk/jog for a bit. It's very nice.</p>
<p>I'm happy I can move more now.</p>
