<p>Yesterday evening I took the time to sit down with my action-list, specifically the one called &quot;At Computer&quot;. And I finally felt relief.</p>
<p>But relief isn't the right kind of word. In the GTD Fast seminars, David Allen talks about how you don't think, and just do. And I actually felt that way. I just plowed through action after action, and when I was done, I had scratched out over 20 entries, some of which were pretty big (in my mind), like doing taxes. Others had been needing tending since august last year, but were now made progress on in minutes.</p>
<p>So yeah, that was pretty cool.</p>
<p>I don't have that much to say about it, other than I felt that the earlier steps really helped turning the productive phase super productive. Less figuring out what to do, more doing.</p>
<p>This post feels super boring, but I'm gonna practice publishing boring things as well. Because I might be wrong.</p>
