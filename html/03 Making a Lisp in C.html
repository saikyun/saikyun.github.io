<h1>Making a Lisp in C</h1>
<p>Today I started working on a lisp in c. I want the lisp to compile to C. I've tried it before, but the first time I got stuck on figuring out what types things should be (assuming I don't want to fill out all the types all the time in lisp). Since then I've done some basic work on <a href="https://github.com/saikyun/unification/tree/10b19ae798b508127fb54fa68ed218c99bdd23f4">unification</a> / type inference. When I tried my first lisp in c, I only found research papers about unification, which I had trouble understanding. I wasn't sure how to learn how to read them either, and ended up listening to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tractatus_Logico-Philosophicus">Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus</a>. It didn't work very well in audiobook form, and it definitely did not help me understand how to read science papers with strange symbols.</p>
<p>Since then, a friend showed me https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2018/unification/ which talked my language a lot better. So I was able to do the basic stuff, finally.</p>
<p>I did start on <a href="https://github.com/saikyun/lisp-to-c">another lisp in c</a> after writing that unification stuff. While I did manage to compile some C from lisp, I got a bit stuck trying to figure out how enable macros (i.e. running lisp while still being in the compilation phase). At least I think that's what happened. I started some work on doing both <code>eval</code> and <code>compile</code>, i.e. an interpreter <em>and</em> a compiler. But it seemed like I would have to write a lot of the same code over and over again.</p>
<p>What I've figured out now is that I somehow want to be able to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Compile lisp code to C</li>
<li>Evaluate lisp code while in the compilation phase, using the same code as step 1. does</li>
</ol>
<p>This seemed tricky, since I didn't know of a way to get <code>eval</code> for C. Then I remembered that my friend told me about <a href="https://bellard.org/tcc/">tcc</a>. tcc is a tiny c compiler, that is easy to build and bundle with your project. Even in the 2nd iteration, I figured I'd use tcc to generate dlls to facilitate live coding. What I didn't realize back then, but figured out now when reading the docs, is that you can <em>use tcc as a library</em>, and <em>compile functions to memory</em>.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/saikyun/libtcc-example">I tried that.</a> It's very awesome. Suddenly you have eval in C.</p>
<p>This means that if I encounter a macro during compilation, I can call some libtcc functions, and get some results, and then use those results when continuing compilation. Pretty cool!</p>
<p>I'm also guessing it'll make live coding ever so slightly faster, since I won't have to start a separate process, compile a dll/so to disk, <code>dlload</code> that dll, e.t.c.</p>
<h2>Third time's the charm</h2>
<p>So now I'm starting again, this time using only C, and trying to make sure everything works with tcc. Sadly I had some <a href="https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/tinycc-devel/2023-04/msg00029.html">problems building binaries</a> on my macbook air m2, but <code>tcc -run</code> does work. So hopefully it can be sorted out.</p>
<p>Ofc what I probably &quot;should&quot; do is either use llvm, or go all the way and just interact with assembly directly, but both those have their problems.</p>
<p>First off, llvm just seems to have slower compile times overall than tcc. Of course it then wins hugely during runtime, but that's not important for <code>eval</code>. My language should be able to AOT compile as well, and then I'd use clang / gcc / cl. But when coding, I figure tcc will speed up development a lot.</p>
<p>Doing something with assembly, instead of having the middle step of C, appeals to me a lot, but I know next to nothing about assembly, while I can do basic stuff in C. And even if I were to learn some sort of assembly, I would be tied hard to whatever platform I decided to learn. With tcc it seems feasibly to build/eval on all desktop platforms, and maybe the browser and phones.</p>
<p>And since my language will build to C in the end, I figure that when you're done coding and want to build binaries, it should be possible to build them for all manners of platforms, including consoles. You lose <code>eval</code>, but while it's a bit boring to lose it, it's not as crucial as it is while developing.</p>
<p>So far I've built the <a href="https://app.slack.com/client/T024SRSB2/C011CD5P1S6">tokenizer</a>. Not much to look at yet. But hopefully it won't be too long until I can call some C functions using my lisp. :)</p>
