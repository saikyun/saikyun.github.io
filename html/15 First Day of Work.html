<h1 id="first-day-of-work"><a href="#first-day-of-work">First Day of Work</a></h1>
<p>Today I had my first day of work. Doing the new work.</p>
<p>It felt good to know that I can work and get an income again. It&#39;s nice doing not much at all, but even nicer to do a little bit of something, and then nothing at all.</p>
<p>Today nothing at all meant getting home early to make surprise dinner for my wife. She seems happy. My son is with his grandpa. It&#39;s strange how rare a walk to the library together with my wife can be.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t understand how you&#39;re meant to work a lot, and have children, and take care of your body. Yesterday I managed to reach my goal of jog/walk/jogging for 30 minutes, which felt great! But I would have had a hard time doing it if I weren&#39;t able to spend part of my work day exercising. Evening time is so chaotic and prone to random events, that it&#39;s hard to make a habit of anything, at least for me.</p>
<p>So I&#39;m very grateful that I&#39;m able to take care of my body better.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve heard that police and firemen get to work out during work time. I wonder why the same isn&#39;t true for programmers?</p>
