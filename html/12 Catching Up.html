<h1 id="catching-up"><a href="#catching-up">Catching Up</a></h1>
<p>Today I finally got the time to sit down and go through my inbox. My book is now filled with tasks and actions.</p>
<p>Trying to get to this point has made me think a bit about doing things, and time.</p>
<p>It's interesting how much time is spent doing things that doesn't feel like you're doing anything. For example, today I woke up at ~8:00 and the clock was 11 or so before I felt I could sit down with my lists. The time inbetween felt like I did nothing, but what I actually did was:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get up</li>
<li>Make breakfast for my son</li>
<li>Send a photo of me holding Way of Kings that arrived during the night (my son took the package in because he has been hype for the latest volume of Handbok för Superhjältar) to my friend who recommended it to me</li>
<li>Poop</li>
<li>Jog and buy saturday candy</li>
<li>Shower</li>
<li>Make breakfast for me and my wife</li>
<li>Eat and talk with my son and wife</li>
<li>Clear out my desk</li>
</ul>
<p>And I'm probably forgetting details, like getting dressed, fetching a towel, making new sections for my action book.</p>
<p>It's just so much stuff! No wonder I feel pressed for time sometimes. It probably doesn't help that I can take some time switching between different contexts. My wife says it's because of autism, I claim it's because of being burnt out. Maybe we're both right. :)</p>
<p>Now my inbox is empty! Or, well, almost. I noticed I had another note in my pocket, but that one doesn't count because it wasn't in my inbox yet. So good enough!</p>
<p>Now I need to find time to actually do the actions.</p>
