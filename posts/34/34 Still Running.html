<p>
  Autumn is here. The sun is shining but the air is cold. My wife says I have
  been sick lately because I'm burnt out, but it might also be because of my son
  having starting the new semester, which tends to bring about all sorts of
  colds.
</p>
<p>
  I've been watching a lot of youtube lately, but don't feel very relaxed by it,
  at least not at the moment. My favourite late night help me sleep youtuber
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@GrimBeard">Grimbeard</a> haven't uploaded
  anything in a while.
</p>
<p>
  I've been feeling a lot more at ease at home though. Somehow being sick
  recalibrated me to want to spend more time at home, so I changed the opening
  times of my board game caf√© again. Right now we're open 12-21 thursdays &amp;
  fridays, 12-16 saturdays. Before I would spend many saturday evenings here as
  well, which I started to feel is a bit too much. My wife hosts game nights
  every other saturday, and I hope to encourage local players to do the same.
  Sometimes though, just ordering a bunch of tags for the lock is too much. I
  did manage to do it yesterday though.
</p>
<p>
  I wanted to write a bit to see if it feels good in a different way from
  watching youtube. I've been wanting to code a bit more lately, which I haven't
  felt like in a year or so. But it's still too hard to just do, I don't feel
  excited by any programming language at the moment. And making my own took to
  long. I think it might be the sort of thing that is hard to do while also
  working with code.
</p>
<p>
  I've thought of looking at <a href="https://crystal-lang.org">Crystal</a> but
  it isn't a lisp so I feel a bit scared. But it looks neat. Would be fun to at
  least follow along a tutorial. It has type inference and macros which is what
  I tried to do with my language.
</p>
<p>Okay. Now I don't feel like writing any more.</p>
