</h1>
<p>
  I've struggled a bit lately with &quot;the meaning of life&quot;. Before the
  question seemed abstract, like a philosophical question. My dad and younger
  son died (about two years ago), and since then, it's like my brain has had a
  hard time figuring out what to do with that. I don't think I've found any
  answers. The question has a more practical meaning: &quot;what do I do?&quot;
</p>
<p>
  Some part of me still thinks it's fun to fiddle with game making and coding.
  But I've also felt a bit disillusioned with games. They can be
  &quot;hooking&quot; or engaging, but I'm not sure it's worthwhile to spend
  time with them. But on the other hand, I think it's hard to find anything
  worthwhile to spend time with. Though even though I think that, I can still
  enjoy many things. I enjoy taking walks with my son. I enjoy playing Magic the
  Gathering, and building decks. I enjoy having sex with my wife. I'm not sure
  enjoyment is a good thing to strive for though.
</p>
<p>
  Another way to see that struggle is something like: if enjoyment is something
  to be pursued, then it's okay to make games, because then I'm making something
  that others can find meaningful. But if it's meaningful to play games, then I
  should play games instead of making them. However, if it's a waste of time to
  play games, then maybe making things is a good idea instead. But if I make
  things that are supposed to be enjoyed by others, then I am making something
  meaningless for them. Kind of tricky.
</p>
<p>
  It feels a bit sad to just wait until I die though. So I figure and feel I
  should do something. It's just such as struggle. I get sick, I hurt my back, I
  get tired. Then it's easier to just play games. Or do nothing and stare. I do
  feel that doing things that lets me engage with others makes me feel at least
  something. Spending more times trying to contribute to communities can feel
  pretty good, at least as long as I'm doing it while having fun. To be less
  abstract, I've found it pretty neat to play more games with others. I wonder
  if I can somehow engage with others while creating things too.
