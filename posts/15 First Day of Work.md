# [First Day of Work](#first-day-of-work)

Today I had my first day of work. Doing the new work.

It felt good to know that I can work and get an income again. It's nice doing not much at all, but even nicer to do a little bit of something, and then nothing at all.

Today nothing at all meant getting home early to make surprise dinner for my wife. She seems happy. My son is with his grandpa. It's strange how rare a walk to the library together with my wife can be.

I don't understand how you're meant to work a lot, and have children, and take care of your body. Yesterday I managed to reach my goal of jog/walk/jogging for 30 minutes, which felt great! But I would have had a hard time doing it if I weren't able to spend part of my work day exercising. Evening time is so chaotic and prone to random events, that it's hard to make a habit of anything, at least for me.

So I'm very grateful that I'm able to take care of my body better.

I've heard that police and firemen get to work out during work time. I wonder why the same isn't true for programmers?
