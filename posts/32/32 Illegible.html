<h1 id="illegible"><a href="#illegible">Illegible</a></h1>
<p>I don't like pushing myself. I feel like it's very common when I push myself that:</p>
<ol>
    <li>I get burnt out (more or less clinically)</li>
    <li>The result isn't worth it</li>
</ol>
<p>When you add to that that everything is meaningless, we get a question:</p>
<p>Is it better to spend a meaningless existence feeling good or feeling bad?</p>
<p>I still remember one time in school. I think I was 13 years old. I was at home, working on an assignment in natural
    science. After having gotten bad grades on assignments multiple times due to illegible hand writing, I put a lot of
    effort into writing properly. This was painful for me. Writing hurt my hand a lot, so my method was generally to
    write as quickly as possible as to lessen the time I had to feel pain.</p>
<p>But this time I wanted to write properly. So I endured the pain. I wrote carefully and slowly, while my hand started
    hurting more and more. I tend to have trouble remembering things, but I do remember finishing the assignment, and
    writing down what song I listened to at that moment. Somehow I had to mark down the occasion, since now I really had
    fought for something.</p>
<p>When handing in the assignment, I even asked my teacher: &quot;Is this legible?&quot;
    He replied: &quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
<p>A few days passed, and I got the assignment back with the grade. I just got the usual passing grade, with a note:
    &quot;illegible&quot;.</p>
