# [Illegible](#illegible)

I don't like pushing myself. I feel like it's very common when I push myself that:

1. I get burnt out (more or less clinically)
2. The result isn't worth it

When you add to that that everything is meaningless, we get a question:

Is it better to spend a meaningless existence feeling good or feeling bad?

I still remember one time in school. I think I was 13 years old. I was at home, working on an assignment in natural science. After having gotten bad grades on assignments multiple times due to illegible hand writing, I put a lot of effort into writing properly. This was painful for me. Writing hurt my hand a lot, so my method was generally to write as quickly as possible as to lessen the time I had to feel pain.

But this time I wanted to write properly. So I endured the pain. I wrote carefully and slowly, while my hand started hurting more and more. I tend to have trouble remembering things, but I do remember finishing the assignment, and writing down what song I listened to at that moment. Somehow I had to mark down the occasion, since now I really had fought for something.

When handing in the assignment, I even asked my teacher: "Is this legible?"
He replied: "Yes."

A few days passed, and I got the assignment back with the grade. I just got the usual passing grade, with a note: "illegible".
