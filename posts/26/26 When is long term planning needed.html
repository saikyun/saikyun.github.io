<p>I often dive into things head first. I like to fix problems, code as quickly as possible while I'm still hype, I hate waiting. I really <em>really</em> hate waiting. Because it's like spending my working time doing nothing. Then when it's time to do something I'm already tired and/or bored.</p>
<p>So I tend to do things one bit at the time.</p>
<p>When I started working on my text editor <a href="https://github.com/saikyun/freja">freja</a>, I didn't sketch out <code>freja-frp</code>, <code>freja-layout</code> and <code>textarea</code>. I just started with the goal of &quot;implement all interactions that are in the Chrome implementation of <code>&lt;textarea&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;</code>&quot;.</p>
<p>This turned out to be a great goal. It's very clear what should be there. Everything in the Chrome textarea. And it's very clear what should not be there. Everything that's not in the Chrome textarea.</p>
<p>Another helpful part was that I constantly communicated my progress with a close friend. So even on non-productive days I could complain about the problems I faced. I can't remember if he did, but I'm sure he brought up interactions I didn't think about at first, like triple clicking or certain funny word wrapping aspects.</p>
<p>After two months or so, I was at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReUczDAWLfI">this stage (youtube, 1min)</a>. At that point I even managed to get some extra stuff in, like syntax highlighting. And a little easter egg for those with a watchful eye. :)</p>
<p>Still, after those two months, I still didn't know what was ahead of me. I had just worked merrily in a way that suited me. I had this vague sense of what an ideal text editor should be, but I didn't say that I must plan everything out ahead.</p>
<p>Then, about a year later, working in a similar way, with smaller problems to solve each week, I released what I call the notepad-complete version of Freja. You could essentially do everything you can in notepad, and then some (live coding in the editor!).</p>
<p>I believe I would never have gone this far if I had tried to plan this process ahead. And this is for a whole text editor. I wonder how many ideas are snuffed out before getting the chance to burn brightly, because of inaction.</p>
