Somehow I managed to get a game of some sort working in my lisp. :D You can move around, collect money, and most importantly: die.

There are some interesting quirks. For example, you can only use `if` as the last expression in a `defn`, or inside `while`. If you do it inside a `while` though, you can only use `if` as a statement, and not an expression. Hm.

```
(var lul :int 0)
(while (< lul 1)
  (if (&& (== 0 (in map to))
          (< to (* mapw maph)))
    (do (printf "YOU DIED\n")
        (set dead 1)))
(set lul 1))
```

So there's some of this littered around.

What's nice is that now I have an example program, stored in git. So now I can go through various pain points (and I've written some down in [QnA.md](https://github.com/saikyun/vajer/blob/main/QnA.md#todo-this-code-breaks-because-of-if-wanting-to-set-a-parents-defns-return-value)). Then over time I can compare my progress to this initial program, and see how much cleaner newer versions of vajer will be. :)
