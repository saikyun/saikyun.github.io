# [Less wonky if in Vajer](#less-wonky-if-in-vajer)

Last time I wrote about Vajer, I had to write if like this:

```
(defn move-up
  [map :char*
   mapw :int
   maph :int] :int
  (var pos :int (- (strchr map 0) map))
  (if (>= (- pos mapw) 0)
    (do
      (put map pos 1)
      (put map (- pos mapw) 0)
      0))
)
```

Because it couldn't deal with void. Also it could _only_ deal with ints.

Now that's fixed! The same function now looks like this:

```
(defn move_up
  [map :char*
   mapw :int
   maph :int] :void
  (var rrr :char* (strchr map 0))
  (var pos :int (- rrr map))
  (if (>= (- pos mapw) 0)
    (move map pos (- pos mapw))))
```

Now that I look at it, it seems some other things changed, but the important one is that I don't need :int return type on the function, and the if doesn't need the do-block and returning an int!
