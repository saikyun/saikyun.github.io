# [Tenth Post!](#tenth-post)

This is my tenth post! I can't write much because my day got taken over by:

1. Fixing the blog so it's more readable on more devices
1. Talking with [Fredrik](https://mastodon.social/@bjoreman@toot.cafe) about code and stuff
1. Talking with people who might give me money to write code
1. Going through a giant list of notes I've collected trying to implement GTD system

Now I'm gonna go make gluten free pizza and play LA Noire with my friend.
