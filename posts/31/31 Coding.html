<p>I like to have a feeling of flow when I code. The best I've felt generally is using Clojure. Here are the main things
    I think helps feeling flow with Clojure:</p>
<ul>
    <li>unrestricted live coding with a repl
        <ul>
            <li>I could rewrite clojure.core (the standard library) while my application was running. that power is very
                useful when experimenting and modifying functions and trying them again. you can set up your state in a
                perfect way for your experiment, then modify the function until it outputs what you expect.
                <ul>
                    <li>this is possible with TDD as well, but sometimes it can be hard/take a long time to set up the
                        state necessary for TDD (maybe the state is hard to serialize), making it more practical to just
                        run your application, make it go into the state you want (e.g. in a game, run to the place where
                        you want to try something), then run/modify/run the function until it does the right thing
                        <ul>
                            <li>an alternative solution to repl'ing here is just having all state be serializeable and
                                have a super fast compiler. I believe that setup would be hard to discern from repl'ing.
                                this is probably how I'd do it with a compiled language :)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>if you don't understand what the above means, it just means that you can modify your program while it is
                running. say you have an animation that you want to tweak, let's say the bounce of a button. let's also
                say that the button is only visible after you have filled in some state (e.g. a submit button that won't
                bounce until you have filled out a form). with live coding, you can modify the code, and instantly see
                how the animation changes, while the form is still filled in. you can also &quot;ask questions&quot;,
                i.e. write code to query the state (&quot;what name is currently inputted?&quot; or &quot;does the email
                fulfil <code>correct-email?</code>?&quot;). I still haven't figured out a nice way to express this
                succintly. it might be something that cannot be told, only shown. if that is the case, <a
                    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1FMk7Js2Rw">here's one place where I try to show it</a></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>immutable data
        <ul>
            <li>it just turns code cleaner, in general. in my current C project I modify pointers which in hindsight has
                turned a lot of my project to mush</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><a href="http://danmidwood.com/content/2014/11/21/animated-paredit.html">paredit</a>
        <ul>
            <li>the elegance of paredit is being able to think about code in a more abstract way. being able to flip two
                branches of an <code>if</code>, or changing the order of two elements in a vector, and having those
                commands use the same hotkey is just so nice when you get into it (<code>transpose-sexps</code> (this is
                emacs, not paredit, but paredit adds a bunch more -- from vscode's perspective it's all paredit))</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>libraries that seldom move
        <ul>
            <li>clojure has a culture of adding onto rather than modifying. Rich Hickey has a <a
                    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyLBGkS5ICk">good talk</a> on why modifying your functions
                often means breaking them.</li>
            <li>this leads to more calm when updating libraries</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>What is the problem with Clojure then? Well, it's on Java. And Java makes it harder to build games. It's slow (and
    Clojure is often even slower), it's harder to build iOS apps, it's harder to deploy for web (especially with the
    build sizes going up (there is ofc CLJS)), it's harder to build for consoles. But my main gripe is that it's slow.
    Immutability doesn't help games all that much either, and writing mutable code in Clojure tends to feel a bit wonky.
</p>
<p>I'm not saying it can't be done. I've made <a href="http://animal-capital.surge.sh">a game</a> on CLJS, and have
    played around with graphics libraries and Clojure. I just feel that it isn't a natural fit. If you could show me a
    code editor written on Java that doesn't feel sluggish and doesn't eat &gt;100mb ram, maybe I could be persuaded
    otherwise. Because I feel that it's the underlying platform that's the main problem.</p>
<p>C on the other hand, doesn't have these problems. It feels very natural to interact with graphic libraries, and it's
    small and fast. Very nice. But it's instead often painful to code in. But in this case, I'm not convinced that the
    underlying platform is the problem. I think here there's space to fix the language instead.</p>
<p>For example, repl'ing is impractical in C, but I think you could fix that.The OS lets you modify your program while
    running, thanks to <code>dlopen</code> -- loading dll / .so-files during runtime. Immutable data is nice for flow,
    but not necessary for games (though you probably want to peek a lot at some of the benefits you get from immutable
    data, like being able to express that values put into a function doesn't change, like non-<code>mut</code>
    parameters in that unnameable oxidizing language). Paredit? Just make the language a lisp and it'll be fine.
    Libraries that seldom move? This is more of a culture thing, but I believe focusing on functions over classes help,
    since functions are easier to add more of. E.g. you could update a library by adding a <code>foo2</code> rather than
    modifying <code>foo</code>, then let the user of the library either use the old one or the new one. No breakage.</p>
<p>So this is what I'm trying to do with <a href="https://github.com/saikyun/vajer">vajer</a>. Sadly I'm currently
    coding it in C, and I'm not a very good C programmer, so I am a bit stuck. So instead of trying to solve it, I'm
    writing some more blog posts.</p>
