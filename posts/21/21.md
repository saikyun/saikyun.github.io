# [Late](#late)

Today is the first time I failed to post a daily blog before 24:00. :O

I managed to make a @ move around with my lisp and sdl, so that was neat.

I got to rebuy a mod for minecraft for my son, because we had bought it on my account before.

My wife and I started watching a new series that is surprisingly good: "KÃ¤rlek och Anarki".

The machines are beeping and whirring. Some of it is comforting. Other sounds more grating, or even shocking sometimes.

I hope the whizzes will lull me to sleep.
