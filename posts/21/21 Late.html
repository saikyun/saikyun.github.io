<h1 id="late"><a href="#late">Late</a></h1>
<p>Today is the first time I failed to post a daily blog before 24:00. :O</p>
<p>I managed to make a @ move around with my lisp and sdl, so that was neat.</p>
<p>I got to rebuy a mod for minecraft for my son, because we had bought it on my account before.</p>
<p>My wife and I started watching a new series that is surprisingly good: &quot;KÃ¤rlek och Anarki&quot;.</p>
<p>The machines are beeping and whirring. Some of it is comforting. Other sounds more grating, or even shocking sometimes.</p>
<p>I hope the whizzes will lull me to sleep.</p>
