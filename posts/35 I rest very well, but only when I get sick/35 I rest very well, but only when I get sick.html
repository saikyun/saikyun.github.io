</h1>
<p>
  It seems that I always must get sick in order to stand still and think. I
  don't think that's very healthy.
</p>
<p>
  I reread a bunch of my old blog posts, and it seems that last time I posted, I
  was also recently sick.
</p>
<p>
  The good part is that I think that I'm finally working a bit less. My sister
  is doing most of the work at the board game caf√©, and while there is
  definitely stuff to fix, and I do have to code 3 days / week, I am able to
  take it easy if I need to...
</p>
<p>And yet I don't.</p>
<p>
  These last few days I have been able to not think about anything, just sleep
  when I need to, eat what I feel like, and play obscene amounts of Backpack
  Battles.
</p>
<p>
  Yesterday my son was well enough to go to school, and immediately one problem
  becomes apparent: going up at a certain (early) time is really rough. It feels
  like most of the day is wrecked after having to get up. I can't really fall
  asleep again afterwards either. Yesterday evening I had a really hard time
  falling asleep as well, not sure why. Which of course means I'm even more
  busted this day.
</p>
<p>
  Having to do &quot;important tasks&quot; (coding, building acoustic panels,
  being nice to my son and wife) while sleep deprived is really, really hard for
  me. Which makes it take longer. Which means I get more tired, and spend more
  time coping (watching youtube / chatting). Which leads to very little time for
  the things I do when I'm sick and just rest.
</p>
<p>I identified a couple of activities that I think benefit me:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sitting / lying down without doing anything</li>
  <li>Taking walks without a destination, even short ones</li>
  <li>Playing games</li>
  <li>
    Adjusting what I do with my family depending on how I feel (instead of on
    how they feel)
  </li>
</ul>
<p>And two major causes of tiredness:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Having alarms</li>
  <li>Having too little unplanned time</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Of course there's a dilemma here. I need to do some things, like working. And
  to do that, I need to make sure to plan time for working.
</p>
<p>
  But I think I still underestimate how much rest I will need surrounding and
  during that work time. Which causes me to not have time for the beneficial
  activities.
