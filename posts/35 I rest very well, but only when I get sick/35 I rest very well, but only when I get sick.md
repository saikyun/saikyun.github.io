# [I rest very well, but only when I get sick](#i-rest-very-well-but-only-when-i-get-sick)

It seems that I always must get sick in order to stand still and think. I don't think that's very healthy.

I reread a bunch of my old blog posts, and it seems that last time I posted, I was also recently sick.

The good part is that I think that I'm finally working a bit less. My sister is doing most of the work at the board game caf√©, and while there is definitely stuff to fix, and I do have to code 3 days / week, I am able to take it easy if I need to...

And yet I don't.

These last few days I have been able to not think about anything, just sleep when I need to, eat what I feel like, and play obscene amounts of Backpack Battles.

Yesterday my son was well enough to go to school, and immediately one problem becomes apparent: going up at a certain (early) time is really rough. It feels like most of the day is wrecked after having to get up. I can't really fall asleep again afterwards either. Yesterday evening I had a really hard time falling asleep as well, not sure why. Which of course means I'm even more busted this day.

Having to do "important tasks" (coding, building acoustic panels, being nice to my son and wife) while sleep deprived is really, really hard for me. Which makes it take longer. Which means I get more tired, and spend more time coping (watching youtube / chatting). Which leads to very little time for the things I do when I'm sick and just rest.

I identified a couple of activities that I think benefit me:

- Sitting / lying down without doing anything
- Taking walks without a destination, even short ones
- Playing games
- Adjusting what I do with my family depending on how I feel (instead of on how they feel)

And two major causes of tiredness:

- Having alarms
- Having too little unplanned time

Of course there's a dilemma here. I need to do some things, like working. And to do that, I need to make sure to plan time for working.

But I think I still underestimate how much rest I will need surrounding and during that work time. Which causes me to not have time for the beneficial activities.
