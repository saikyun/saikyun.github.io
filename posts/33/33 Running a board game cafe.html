<p>I started the board game café <a href="https://ektrollet.se">Ektrollet</a> in august. It's pretty nice. I get to be
    around board games all day, and on mondays we have game nights where I play great games while &quot;working&quot; (I
    still serve coffee, I always have enough time to play since I don't cook food/make coffee drinks during game
    nights).</p>
<p>Right now Ektrollet seems to pretty consistently sell for 12k SEK per month. Since only the rent is 10k, right now
    we're not going plus. We are in a small town (3k people in the municipality) and still very new, so it is to be
    expected. Vadstena is a very popular vacation town, so probably most of the income will be during summer.</p>
<p>What's nice though, is that there are still new people coming in, so I think we might be able to get more local
    customers over time as well. We haven't done much with the signage outside either, so multiple customers have come
    in and been surprised that we serve Latte.</p>
<p>It's hard to find time to do many of the &quot;upgrady&quot; things though, like designing signs and printing
    posters. To not lose our capital too quickly, I consult as a coder as well. So many of my days look something like:
</p>
<p>07:00 Wake up
    07:50 Take son to school
    08:15 Eat breakfast
    09:00 Exercise and shower
    10:00 Start coding
    10:30 My wife opens and starts working in the café. We open 12:00, but it takes 1-1.5h to open.
    14:00 Done coding (I try to code for 3h, and take one ~30m break)
    14:30 My wife quits, and I start working in the café
    17:00 Closing time (unless it's a monday :D)
    17:30 Done closing, go home and be with my son until he sleeps at 20:30
    20:30 Relax, play something, read something
    21:30 Preparing to go to bed</p>
<p>With this schedule I feel that my mental and physical health is doing pretty well! But there's not much time over to
    improve the café. Some days I have some creative energy left after 14:30, and it might be empty, so then I make the
    website or write our newsletter etc etc.</p>

<p>Right now the big project is preparing for and installing the new coffee machine, a Uniq Stella 2 Group. Me and my
    father-in-law are building a new counter on which it will stand, and into which we will install a milk jug cleaner
    and a knockbox. :D</p>
<p>So far I've been using a La Pavoni Esperto, which I love, but it's not great at making multiple coffee drinks
    simultaneously. With the La Pavoni the workflow for a Latte is something like:</p>
<p><img src="/posts/33/la_pavoni.jpg" alt="La Pavoni"></p>
<ol>
    <li>Put portafilter on scale, fill it up with 19g coffee</li>
    <li>Grind the coffee</li>
    <li>Measure again, make sure it's 18g (the grinder eats some coffee)</li>
    <li>Release &quot;fake steam&quot; (I have no idea what this is, but I do it because the manual told me)</li>
    <li>Insert the portafilter into the La Pavoni</li>
    <li>Raise the lever, hold it up for at least 10 seconds</li>
    <li>Lower the lever until I feel resistance, hold it still for 3 seconds</li>
    <li>Raise the lever for 3 seconds</li>
    <li>Push down with 5-8 bars resistance (depending on grind size) for 30 seconds</li>
    <li>Pour the resulting espresso into a large glass</li>
    <li>Pour milk in a jug 225ml</li>
    <li>Steam the milk, takes about 60 seconds I think</li>
    <li>Pour the milk into the glass with the espresso</li>
</ol>
<p>This process I think takes about 5 minutes, possibly more. It's also extremely serial. I can't do any of these steps
    at the same time that I do anything else. It also takes longer to steam with the La Pavoni than a bigger machine, at
    least that's what I've heard. I think it has to do with the pressure of the machine. La Pavoni has 0.5-1 bar
    pressure in the tank, while the Uniq Stella has 9 bars. I think that means more heat, and it definitely means more
    steam going out into the milk faster.</p>

<p>With the Uniq Stella, I'll also be able to condense step 4-9 into a single step 4: press the button. And while that
    button has been pressed, I can do other tasks, like grind beans for another drink. It should also be possible to
    place milk jugs in a way that allows the 30 seconds of steaming to happen while I do other things. So I can
    potentially go from 1 drink in 5 minutes, to 2 drinks in 2-3 minutes! I don't know what sort of speed I'll be able
    to achieve, but it's definitely going to be faster. :)</p>
