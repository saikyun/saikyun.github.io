# [Running a board game café](#running-a-board-game-cafe)

I started the board game café [Ektrollet](https://ektrollet.se) in august. It's pretty nice. I get to be around board games all day, and on mondays we have game nights where I play great games while "working" (I still serve coffee, I always have enough time to play since I don't cook food/make coffee drinks during game nights).

Right now Ektrollet seems to pretty consistently sell for 12k SEK per month. Since only the rent is 10k, right now we're not going plus. We are in a small town (3k people in the municipality) and still very new, so it is to be expected. Vadstena is a very popular vacation town, so probably most of the income will be during summer.

What's nice though, is that there are still new people coming in, so I think we might be able to get more local customers over time as well. We haven't done much with the signage outside either, so multiple customers have come in and been surprised that we serve Latte.

It's hard to find time to do many of the "upgrady" things though, like designing signs and printing posters. To not lose our capital too quickly, I consult as a coder as well. So many of my days look something like:

07:00 Wake up
07:50 Take son to school
08:15 Eat breakfast
09:00 Exercise and shower
10:00 Start coding
10:30 My wife opens and starts working in the café. We open 12:00, but it takes 1-1.5h to open.
14:00 Done coding (I try to code for 3h, and take one ~30m break)
14:30 My wife quits, and I start working in the café
17:00 Closing time (unless it's a monday :D)
17:30 Done closing, go home and be with my son until he sleeps at 20:30
20:30 Relax, play something, read something
21:30 Preparing to go to bed

With this schedule I feel that my mental and physical health is doing pretty well! But there's not much time over to improve the café. Some days I have some creative energy left after 14:30, and it might be empty, so then I make the website or write our newsletter etc etc.

Right now the big project is preparing for and installing the new coffee machine, a Uniq Stella 2 Group. Me and my father-in-law are building a new counter on which it will stand, and into which we will install a milk jug cleaner and a knockbox. :D

So far I've been using a La Pavoni Esperto, which I love, but it's not great at making multiple coffee drinks simultaneously. With the La Pavoni the workflow for a Latte is something like:

![La Pavoni](/posts/33/la_pavoni.jpg)

1. Put portafilter on scale, fill it up with 19g coffee
2. Grind the coffee
3. Measure again, make sure it's 18g (the grinder eats some coffee)
4. Release "fake steam" (I have no idea what this is, but I do it because the manual told me)
5. Insert the portafilter into the La Pavoni
6. Raise the lever, hold it up for at least 10 seconds
7. Lower the lever until I feel resistance, hold it still for 3 seconds
8. Raise the lever for 3 seconds
9. Push down with 5-8 bars resistance (depending on grind size) for 30 seconds
10. Pour the resulting espresso into a large glass
11. Pour milk in a jug 225ml
12. Steam the milk, takes about 60 seconds I think
13. Pour the milk into the glass with the espresso

This process I think takes about 5 minutes, possibly more. It's also extremely serial. I can't do any of these steps at the same time that I do anything else. It also takes longer to steam with the La Pavoni than a bigger machine, at least that's what I've heard. I think it has to do with the pressure of the machine. La Pavoni has 0.5-1 bar pressure in the tank, while the Uniq Stella has 9 bars. I think that means more heat, and it definitely means more steam going out into the milk faster.

With the Uniq Stella, I'll also be able to condense step 4-9 into a single step 4: press the button. And while that button has been pressed, I can do other tasks, like grind beans for another drink. It should also be possible to place milk jugs in a way that allows the 30 seconds of steaming to happen while I do other things. So I can potentially go from 1 drink in 5 minutes, to 2 drinks in 2-3 minutes! I don't know what sort of speed I'll be able to achieve, but it's definitely going to be faster. :)
