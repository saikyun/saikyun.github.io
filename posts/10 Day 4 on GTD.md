# [Day 4 on GTD](#day-4-on-gtd)

Since starting to note everything down, as per Orthodox GTD Dogma, I'm realizing I have way more obligations than I thought. In a single day I noted over 20 things for my inbox plus email plus texts. And I don't even have a job!

A sample of things in my inbox:
* Dinosaurs (for the RPG session I'm planning for my son & wife, we recently made characters for the [Handbok för Superhjältar](https://handbokforsuperhjaltar.se/butik/spel/rollspel/handbok-for-superhjaltar-rollspelet/) role playing game)
* Check Twitter
* Remove rug from balcony
* Contact son's friend's mom to plan playdate
* Brett Victor, Future of Code and Learning Programming
* Sun lamp
* Check SMS from my wife (I accidentally read it but I need to remember to put it in my inbox)
* Get Megaman Legends for a let's play that I'm doing with two friends

It's just a lot of stuff!!

And I have even more already that has undergone the holy ritual of "processing", which means they are deciphered into "Goal" and "Action", and are under categories such as "At Home" or "By Computer" or "Projects".

Oh great, I just found another note. 10 more things, so 30 for today.

I'm a bit happy to get all these obligations down on paper, but I also notice I feel stress that it takes so much time to just process all of these notes. I hope I'll reach a point when there won't be too much new stuff, and I can spend a bit more time actually doing some of the actions I've written down.

What are your experiences with GTD or similar systems?
