# [Vajer Progress](#vajer-progress)

Today I was able to create a character that can move around on the screen. [Code](https://github.com/saikyun/vajer/blob/main/lisp/sdl-test.lisp)

Some reflections:

* I have a vague sense I need to deal with memory management soon, but it hasn't come up yet really
* Atm I kinda copy [https://janet-lang.org](janet)'s style, which might be good but maybe I need to think about some things
* Probably will want to be able to define structs soon
* I want macros soon too, like defining `(++ x)` instead of `(set x (+ x 1))` (assuming I keep janet style)
* I feel like I can do a lot already!
