<p>Today I was able to create a character that can move around on the screen. <a href="https://github.com/saikyun/vajer/blob/main/lisp/sdl-test.lisp">Code</a></p>
<p>Some reflections:</p>
<ul>
<li>I have a vague sense I need to deal with memory management soon, but it hasn't come up yet really</li>
<li>Atm I kinda copy <a href="janet">https://janet-lang.org</a>'s style, which might be good but maybe I need to think about some things</li>
<li>Probably will want to be able to define structs soon</li>
<li>I want macros soon too, like defining <code>(++ x)</code> instead of <code>(set x (+ x 1))</code> (assuming I keep janet style)</li>
<li>I feel like I can do a lot already!</li>
</ul>
