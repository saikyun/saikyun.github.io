<p>Today was a pretty strange day, so here are my top three back exercises. Please be careful and listen to your body, I have no clue if these are for you, so try them at your own peril. I got them from a physical therapist though, and I believe they are fairly gentle.</p>
<p>I don't know their names, so I'll just name them something.</p>
<h2>The band puller</h2>
<ol>
<li>Put a rubber band under your right foot</li>
<li>Stand straight</li>
<li>Put your right hand forward, at the level of your hips</li>
<li>With the hand in this position, adjust the band so that it is just starting to stretch</li>
<li>Pull your hand and the band upwards, so that your hand pointing straight forward, at the level of your shoulder</li>
<li>Slowly move your hand down to the starting position</li>
<li>Repeat 5-10 times, then change hand and foot. Do the same, and repeat for a total of 15-30 times per side</li>
</ol>
<p>Progression: Use a rubber band with more resistance</p>
<h2>Super Person</h2>
<ol>
<li>Stand on all fours, hands under shoulders, knees under your hips</li>
<li>Lift your right arm, hold it straight forward, in level with your head, for a breath, then put it back down</li>
<li>Repeat with your left arm, then right, etc, for a total of 5-15 repetitions per arm</li>
</ol>
<p>Progression: Increase the number and length of your breaths
Next level: Straighten your left leg, point it straight back, when you lift your right hand</p>

<h2>Spine-into-floor-pusher</h2>
<ol>
<li>Lie down on your back, with your feet a bit away from your butt, so that your legs make a sort of triangle</li>
<li>Push your back into the floor. You'll want to use your &quot;core&quot; more than your stomach, you can verify that you're doing this by feeling right above your pelvis, especially to the sides. You should feel muscles tense here</li>
<li>Hold that position for 5 breaths, then release</li>
<li>Repeat 10-20 times</li>
</ol>

<p>Progression: Keep one leg straight forward, and lift it ever so slightly above the ground. The lower you keep your leg (without touching the ground), the harder it will be</p>
<p>These exercises help me a lot when my back hurts. I hope they can be helpful for you as well. :)</p>
