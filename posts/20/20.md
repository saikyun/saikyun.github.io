# [Back Exercises](#back-exercises)

Today was a pretty strange day, so here are my top three back exercises. Please be careful and listen to your body, I have no clue if these are for you, so try them at your own peril. I got them from a physical therapist though, and I believe they are fairly gentle.

I don't know their names, so I'll just name them something.

## The band puller

1. Put a rubber band under your right foot
2. Stand straight
3. Put your right hand forward, at the level of your hips
4. With the hand in this position, adjust the band so that it is just starting to stretch
5. Pull your hand and the band upwards, so that your hand pointing straight forward, at the level of your shoulder
6. Slowly move your hand down to the starting position
7. Repeat 5-10 times, then change hand and foot. Do the same, and repeat for a total of 15-30 times per side

Progression: Use a rubber band with more resistance

## Super Person

1. Stand on all fours, hands under shoulders, knees under your hips
2. Lift your right arm, hold it straight forward, in level with your head, for a breath, then put it back down
3. Repeat with your left arm, then right, etc, for a total of 5-15 repetitions per arm

Progression: Increase the number and length of your breaths
Next level: Straighten your left leg, point it straight back, when you lift your right hand

## Spine-into-floor-pusher

1. Lie down on your back, with your feet a bit away from your butt, so that your legs make a sort of triangle
2. Push your back into the floor. You'll want to use your "core" more than your stomach, you can verify that you're doing this by feeling right above your pelvis, especially to the sides. You should feel muscles tense here
3. Hold that position for 5 breaths, then release
4. Repeat 10-20 times

Progression: Keep one leg straight forward, and lift it ever so slightly above the ground. The lower you keep your leg (without touching the ground), the harder it will be

These exercises help me a lot when my back hurts. I hope they can be helpful for you as well. :)
