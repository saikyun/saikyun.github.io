# Tired

Yesterday I had seemingly endless amounts of energy. And today I feel very tired. If this had been a regular workday, I would have been whipping myself over the lack of productivity. Luckily, I'm currently on paid leave, so I don't have to worry so much.

Until I start thinking about how I will soon die, of course.

In the face of that, tired days can really feel like a waste. I think I've come up with a spell that helps though. What I've thought is something like this:

* If you try to get good at something -- let's say drawing -- and it takes ten years, but you die after five, is it meaningful?

* If it is not, then you should probably not be drawing. I mean, even if you didn't die, you might get injured, or you might get tired of drawing, or your life changes in such a way that you can't spend as much time on drawing.

* Therefore, it must be meaningful, even if we don't get good at it.

* In that case, what happens if you spend half as much time on drawing per week, and it would take 20 years to get good at it? The numbers are different, but the equation is the same, right? You might die after 5 or 10, it doesn't matter really. Even if you die after 1 day, it must still be meaningful.

With this in mind, it doesn't matter if you are tired one day, because the striving toward getting good at drawing is worth it anyway.

And if it isn't, you should probably quit.
