# [Exercise and ADHD](#exercise-and-adhd)

I wonder how much less people with ADHD would suffer if they got sufficient exercise.

I feel both anxiety and sleeplessness decrease when I exercise.

I read that when children get to exercise that got their hearts going as little as 5 minutes in the morning, before classes, they were better at focusing.

I wonder how many get medicated when maybe they should just get a chance to exercise more.

I'm sure some people need medication, I just wonder if there are enough economic interests in getting people to move around more.

My back pain is eradicated after I jog/walk/jog for a bit. It's very nice.

I'm happy I can move more now.
