        <h1>Casey</h1>
        <p>This post has been hard for me to get to. But I feel that I want to get it out, for multiple reasons. First
            of all, I want to be able to keep writing personal blog posts, but it feels like I'm skipping over something
            important if I don't write about this. Secondly, I want as many as possible to know about my son Casey. He
            has an older brother, who can talk for himself (right now he wants to be a streamer). But Casey can't talk,
            so I figure I'll have to talk for him.</p>
        <p>My son Casey was supposed to be born mid august. Actually the same day that his brother would start school.
            Instead, he was very eager to join us. A bit too eager.</p>
        <p>We had traveled to Stockholm, the day before my mom's birthday, to give her a surprise celebration. That went
            well, we had a really nice dinner at great vegan place Hermans.</p>
        <p>Then me, my pregnant wife (with yet unnamed Casey included) and Casey's brother went to our hotel, and slept
            well.</p>
        <p>I suddenly wake up, in the middle of the night, to hear my wife swearing. I find her in the bathroom with the
            floor covered in blood. We call an ambulance, try to pass the time by talking, all while Casey's brother is
            sleeping soundly in his bed.</p>
        <p>An hour later, the ambulance comes, drives my wife away while I have to get Casey's brother to his grandma.
            Then I drive to where I think my wife is, and manage to find her joking with the nurses, doctors and
            midwives. Everything seems fine. Casey has a good pulse, and my wife is all right. They couldn't quite
            figure out what happened. Turns out that it's hard to debug problems inside another person's body.
            Especially when that person has another person in it, a very sensitive person which don't do too well with
            prodding and regular diagnostic tools.</p>
        <p>I don't feel like writing about the whole hospital visit right now, but I can summarize it by saying that
            during 10 days we:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>were treated very kindly</li>
            <li>got informed that even this early (week 20 something), Casey had a 85% survival chance with only minor
                complications. Pretty close to a 2+ roll on a d6.</li>
            <li>named Casey Casey, about the only thing I could be helpful with was come up with name suggestions. since
                Casey's brother's name starts with a J, just like mine, I thought I could look for nice names starting
                on C, like my wife's name.</li>
            <li>watched shows on netflix</li>
            <li>had some troubling moments</li>
            <li>got visits from Casey's brother and his grandma</li>
            <li>travelled by helicopter (my wife) and train (me) to a different hospital (closer to our home)</li>
        </ol>
        <p>After a while, everything seemed fine. 10 days had passed with sort-of relatively minor hiccups. Now-named
            Casey's pulse was generally stable (as stable as a person-in-person's pulse can be, apparantly it fluctuates
            a lot even when everything is going well). I bought some board games and played them with my wife.
            Everything was so calm it was decided that I go home with Casey's brother, who hasn't been able to be much
            with us during all this time. He has never been away so much from us before.</p>
        <p>I go home with Casey's brother, and it's nice to finally be back home. I take him to preschool, and relax and
            work a bit during the day. I think I talk to my wife on the phone, and everything is calm. Evening comes, I
            put Casey's brother to bed, and stay up a bit and work. I'm very proud over my new, portable computer set
            up, which has an elevated stand for my laptop, under which I can have a small keyboard and a trackball.</p>
        <p>Then, I think between 21:00-22:00, my wife calls. Apparently they haven't seen Casey's pulse in a while.
            That's not alarming in itself. During the whole visit, there has been a lot of trouble finding Casey's pulse
            with the CTG-machine (the machine that tracks his pulse). Still though, it takes so long that we decide that
            I should come to the hospital. I call my friend/neighbour to come over (and Casey's grandpa to take over,
            but he lives a bit further away), and as soon as I saw my friend, I went to the car. I called my wife and we
            talk. While driving, the doctors decide that they have to do a emergency c-section. The worry on her
            otherwise extremely calm voice rings through as the hangs up. I drive legally at first, but when I come out
            on the essentially empty highway, I turn up the speed.</p>
        <p>Earlier during our visit, we got to see what would happen in case Casey would be born too early. Apparently
            hand hygiene is extremely important. So when I finally get to the hospital, and the nurse tells me that my
            wife's still in surgery, and that I should come with her. I ask her how my wife and Casey are doing, but the
            nurse says she doesn't know. I ask if I should sanitize my hands. She says no, but since I remember that it
            was very important, I do it anyway. When thinking about it later, I wonder if she already knew it wouldn't
            be necessary.</p>
        <p>The nurse takes me through dark hallways, and leads me to a room which I believe was connected to the surgery
            room. A crowd of nurses, midwives are standing around a table. They move aside and let me sit down. Then
            they tell me that Casey didn't make it. They let me hold him. And he is so beautiful. He has perfect little
            fingers, and he has curly, dark hair, just like mine. Obviously I cry a lot, as I do when I write this. It
            feels truly unfair that I'm not able to hold him.</p>
        <p>I ask to be alone with him for a while, since my wife is still in the process of waking up. It felt
            &quot;good&quot; to be alone with him, because it was the only chance I ever got. Later I go up with the
            nurses, still holding Casey, and tell my wife what happened.</p>
        <p>We stay for a couple of days, cry a lot. Talk to doctors and let friends and family who wants to visit Casey
            see him. Maybe this sounds strange to some people, but from what I've learned it is generally good for
            grieving to be able to see that the person you loved is dead.</p>
        <p>At the end we put his body in a coffin. It's very sad to see a baby sized coffin.</p>
        <p>A month later we buried him. It was also very sad. Aloud I read a text I had written, about wanting to eat
            ice cream with him. I cried a lot.</p>
        <p>I hesitated on whether to include the text or not, but I feel like it is a good text about Casey. It's in
            swedish.</p>

        <p>This week we got the burial stone. It looks very pretty. If he was born when he was supposed to, he would
            have been two months old now.</p>
        <p>I wish I could hold Casey.</p>
