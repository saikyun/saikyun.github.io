<p>Okay, so you want to read something sad and personal? Then I just wanted to give you a trigger warning. Since I don't
    know anything about you, I just figured I'd be clear beforehand what the post is about.</p>
<p>So, the trigger warning is: death of a child</p>
<p>Do you still want to read? In the next link comes the actual post.</p>
