<h1 id="would-you-hire-yourself"><a href="#would-you-hire-yourself">Would You Hire Yourself?</a></h1>
<p>As is usually the case when I am tired but get time to lay still in bed all morning (not that common with a 6 year old son), my mind starts visiting interesting places.</p>
<p>When I am stressed, it's sadly mostly about work. But lately, it seems that those processes have slowed down. Perhaps because I got fired from the last job I was stressed at. My current work feels more manageable, and I'm able to exercise 5 times per week.</p>
<p>This morning, one of the interesting things that popped up was the question &quot;would I hire myself?&quot;. Something struck a chord when I &quot;heard&quot; this, and I think it's sort of an interesting question to explore.</p>
<p>Since the economy was rough in the last company I worked for, I got the &quot;ephiphany&quot; of: for every crown you get paid, you should earn your company two crowns. If you can't do that, you're probably not working in an economically sustainable way.</p>
<p>Since then (a full two months ago) I've started to ask myself this before considering working with someone: will I bring more than I cost?</p>
<p>I think the way I'm working right now, that's definitely true. I believe I am adding a lot toward the goals of the company, which are also things people are willing to pay for.</p>
<p>The &quot;would I hire myself?&quot; question is a bit broader though. Because with that framing, one gets a bit of company culture, morality and personality traits into the mix.</p>
<p>I've struggled a lot with reporting time, because if you judge me by &quot;how well do I sit in front of a computer 40 hours per week and have the job's code open in my editor?&quot; I'm a terrible programmer. I have a kid who gets sick often, I'm a feminist which means I want to share household work (and there are hints that <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10508-022-02397-2">this is good for the relationship</a> as well (which seems kind of obvious but also seems like many men don't bother)) some of which includes dropping off my son at preschool and making sure dinner is ready. So if the above criteria is how I'd hire me, I would say no. Never. I'd just hire someone fresh out of college (or still in), give them 50% of what I ask for, and they could chug along merrily with all of their youthful energy and boundless time.</p>
<p>So what I've done then, though not stated explicitly, is something like asking myself, &quot;ok, so in what situation <em>would</em> I hire myself in?&quot;. What I came up with is something like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>I need to be able to take care of my son when he's sick</li>
<li>I need to drop him off at 09:00 and be done with work 17:00, and I need to exercise and eat lunch inbetween</li>
<li>I need to be able to have tired days</li>
<li>I don't want to deal with people planning that I should do x thing on precisely y day, which always gets wrecked because of someone getting sick</li>
</ol>
<p>What I came up with then, is that I should work at most 4 hours per day. That would mean I have 8 hours - 4 hours = 4 hours to be lazy and exercise. What this also means is that if he's sick one day, and my wife takes care of him the next, it's at least feasible (if hard) to work a bit longer and catch up, whereas with an expected &quot;8 hour in front of screen per day&quot;, catching up and doing 16 hours is impossible for me.</p>
<p>With this in mind, I can proudly answer the question of &quot;how well do I sit in front of a computer <strong>20</strong> hours per week and have the job's code open in my editor?&quot; and say &quot;very well!&quot;. Even with life's hiccups, I can do that pretty sustainably.</p>
<p>Now, what I haven't even started getting into is what other questions I could ask myself, which are a different way of looking at the problem, questions that would make me look better than less experienced developers.</p>
<p>&quot;How well do you manage unclear specifications?&quot; No problem.  <br>
&quot;Do you enjoy mentoring others?&quot; Yes!  <br>
&quot;Can we put you alone in a room with a client and you'll figure everything out and deliver a product without essentially any hand-holding?&quot; Hell yeah! I love talking to clients and users and all that stuff. I love making sure users enjoy using the tools I build for them. :D</p>
<p>With these criterions, and still having fulfilled the nebolous &quot;can you sit in front of computer x amount of hours&quot; for a high enough number of x, I can proudly say:</p>
<p>&quot;Yes! I would hire myself!&quot;</p>
