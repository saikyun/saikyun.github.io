      </h1>
      <p>
        Okay, so on some level, I've reached a conclusion: it feels better to do
        something than to do nothing. It feels better to do things with others
        than to do them by myself.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some things I do are easier to do together with others. I played Fevidek
        with my friend and my oldest little sister. It was nice. We talked more
        than we played, but it's fun to occupy ourselves something as well. Why?
        I don't know. It's an excuse to hang out. Why is an excuse needed? I
        don't know. But now that the game is completed, we talk about the next
        game to play, because we want to hang out more. Of course we want to
        experience the games as well, but the games I play with others I would
        never have mustered the energy to complete by myself.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many of the hobbies I've nurtured has had a mix of &quot;doing something
        by myself&quot; and &quot;doing something with others&quot;. In fighting
        games like Street Fighter, and even more in Marvel VS Capcom, you need
        to practice by yourself. And then you want to show off what you've
        learnt by playing with (and hopefully crushing) others. A long time the
        netcode for fighting games was bad, so it was superior to meet up and
        play. I still think it is.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now I play a lot of Magic. You build your deck by yourself, and then you
        meet others and play. And then the loop starts over. You always have
        something to talk about. Player drama and stories about games. New or
        old cards you found synergies with. Cards with cool art.
      </p>
      <p>
        My experience is that the software I've enjoyed writing the most has
        worked in similar ways. I write a bit, I show it to someone, I write a
        bit, show. It becomes a process that makes the brain glow a little bit
        all the time. It's fun to come up with solutions for problems, and it's
        fun to share. The problem is that it's kind of hard to find people who
        stands listening. Many people like to play games. Not as many enjoys
        hearing details about code that barely grew since last time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Two days ago I watched the presentation
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJzV0CX0q8o"
          >&quot;What it means to be open&quot; by Lu Wilson at Heart of Clojure
          2024</a
        >
        It was pretty neat, and inspired me to think a bit more about how I can
        do things. The gist of it is that Lu had a good time sharing some
        creation every day, even if it wasn't super interesting.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the internet there are a lot of nerds who finds nerdy things
        interesting. Some seem to want to hear about how someone is building
        something, if things are progressing well or if it's a pain. So maybe
        there's something there. To build things, and make them accessible to
        others. Put a little bit of effort into making it relatable to others
        what I'm doing. Put make-up on the pig. Be inviting, give an excuse to
        hang out.

          >The Meaning of Life</a
        >
      </h1>
      <p>
        I've struggled a bit lately with &quot;the meaning of life&quot;. Before
        the question seemed abstract, like a philosophical question. My dad and
        younger son died (about two years ago), and since then, it's like my
        brain has had a hard time figuring out what to do with that. I don't
        think I've found any answers. The question has a more practical meaning:
        &quot;what do I do?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
        Some part of me still thinks it's fun to fiddle with game making and
        coding. But I've also felt a bit disillusioned with games. They can be
        &quot;hooking&quot; or engaging, but I'm not sure it's worthwhile to
        spend time with them. But on the other hand, I think it's hard to find
        anything worthwhile to spend time with. Though even though I think that,
        I can still enjoy many things. I enjoy taking walks with my son. I enjoy
        playing Magic the Gathering, and building decks. I enjoy having sex with
        my wife. I'm not sure enjoyment is a good thing to strive for though.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another way to see that struggle is something like: if enjoyment is
        something to be pursued, then it's okay to make games, because then I'm
        making something that others can find meaningful. But if it's meaningful
        to play games, then I should play games instead of making them. However,
        if it's a waste of time to play games, then maybe making things is a
        good idea instead. But if I make things that are supposed to be enjoyed
        by others, then I am making something meaningless for them. Kind of
        tricky.
      </p>
      <p>
        It feels a bit sad to just wait until I die though. So I figure and feel
        I should do something. It's just such as struggle. I get sick, I hurt my
        back, I get tired. Then it's easier to just play games. Or do nothing
        and stare. I do feel that doing things that lets me engage with others
        makes me feel at least something. Spending more times trying to
        contribute to communities can feel pretty good, at least as long as I'm
        doing it while having fun. To be less abstract, I've found it pretty
        neat to play more games with others. I wonder if I can somehow engage
        with others while creating things too.
      </p>

        >
      </h1>
      <p>
        It seems that I always must get sick in order to stand still and think.
        I don't think that's very healthy.
      </p>
      <p>
        I reread a bunch of my old blog posts, and it seems that last time I
        posted, I was also recently sick.
      </p>
      <p>
        The good part is that I think that I'm finally working a bit less. My
        sister is doing most of the work at the board game café, and while there
        is definitely stuff to fix, and I do have to code 3 days / week, I am
        able to take it easy if I need to...
      </p>
      <p>And yet I don't.</p>
      <p>
        These last few days I have been able to not think about anything, just
        sleep when I need to, eat what I feel like, and play obscene amounts of
        Backpack Battles.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yesterday my son was well enough to go to school, and immediately one
        problem becomes apparent: going up at a certain (early) time is really
        rough. It feels like most of the day is wrecked after having to get up.
        I can't really fall asleep again afterwards either. Yesterday evening I
        had a really hard time falling asleep as well, not sure why. Which of
        course means I'm even more busted this day.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having to do &quot;important tasks&quot; (coding, building acoustic
        panels, being nice to my son and wife) while sleep deprived is really,
        really hard for me. Which makes it take longer. Which means I get more
        tired, and spend more time coping (watching youtube / chatting). Which
        leads to very little time for the things I do when I'm sick and just
        rest.
      </p>
      <p>I identified a couple of activities that I think benefit me:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Sitting / lying down without doing anything</li>
        <li>Taking walks without a destination, even short ones</li>
        <li>Playing games</li>
        <li>
          Adjusting what I do with my family depending on how I feel (instead of
          on how they feel)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>And two major causes of tiredness:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Having alarms</li>
        <li>Having too little unplanned time</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Of course there's a dilemma here. I need to do some things, like
        working. And to do that, I need to make sure to plan time for working.
      </p>
      <p>
        But I think I still underestimate how much rest I will need surrounding
        and during that work time. Which causes me to not have time for the
        beneficial activities.

      <h1 id="still-running"><a href="#still-running">Still Running</a></h1>
      <p>
        Autumn is here. The sun is shining but the air is cold. My wife says I
        have been sick lately because I'm burnt out, but it might also be
        because of my son having starting the new semester, which tends to bring
        about all sorts of colds.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've been watching a lot of youtube lately, but don't feel very relaxed
        by it, at least not at the moment. My favourite late night help me sleep
        youtuber
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@GrimBeard">Grimbeard</a> haven't
        uploaded anything in a while.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've been feeling a lot more at ease at home though. Somehow being sick
        recalibrated me to want to spend more time at home, so I changed the
        opening times of my board game café again. Right now we're open 12-21
        thursdays &amp; fridays, 12-16 saturdays. Before I would spend many
        saturday evenings here as well, which I started to feel is a bit too
        much. My wife hosts game nights every other saturday, and I hope to
        encourage local players to do the same. Sometimes though, just ordering
        a bunch of tags for the lock is too much. I did manage to do it
        yesterday though.
      </p>
      <p>
        I wanted to write a bit to see if it feels good in a different way from
        watching youtube. I've been wanting to code a bit more lately, which I
        haven't felt like in a year or so. But it's still too hard to just do, I
        don't feel excited by any programming language at the moment. And making
        my own took to long. I think it might be the sort of thing that is hard
        to do while also working with code.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've thought of looking at
        <a href="https://crystal-lang.org">Crystal</a> but it isn't a lisp so I
        feel a bit scared. But it looks neat. Would be fun to at least follow
        along a tutorial. It has type inference and macros which is what I tried
        to do with my language.
      </p>
      <p>Okay. Now I don't feel like writing any more.</p>

      <h1 id="running-a-board-game-cafe">
        <a href="#running-a-board-game-cafe">Running a board game café</a>
      </h1>
      <p>
        I started the board game café
        <a href="https://ektrollet.se">Ektrollet</a> in august. It's pretty
        nice. I get to be around board games all day, and on mondays we have
        game nights where I play great games while &quot;working&quot; (I still
        serve coffee, I always have enough time to play since I don't cook
        food/make coffee drinks during game nights).
      </p>
      <p>
        Right now Ektrollet seems to pretty consistently sell for 12k SEK per
        month. Since only the rent is 10k, right now we're not going plus. We
        are in a small town (3k people in the municipality) and still very new,
        so it is to be expected. Vadstena is a very popular vacation town, so
        probably most of the income will be during summer.
      </p>
      <p>
        What's nice though, is that there are still new people coming in, so I
        think we might be able to get more local customers over time as well.
        Many of the locals are super nice and hype as well, which gives both me
        and my wife a huge energy boost. :D We have some regulars too, and it
        feels like we're building something meaningful. :) We haven't done much
        with the signage outside either, so multiple customers have come in and
        been surprised that we serve Latte.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's hard to find time to do many of the &quot;upgrady&quot; things
        though, like designing signs and printing posters. To not lose our
        capital too quickly, I consult as a coder as well. So many of my days
        look something like:
      </p>
      <p>
        07:00 Wake up <br />
        07:50 Take son to school <br />
        08:15 Eat breakfast <br />
        09:00 Exercise and shower <br />
        10:00 Start coding <br />
        10:30 My wife opens and starts working in the café. We open 12:00, but
        it takes 1-1.5h to open <br />
        14:00 Done coding (I try to code for 3h, and take one ~30m break) <br />
        14:30 My wife quits, and I start working in the café <br />
        17:00 Closing time (unless it's a monday :D) <br />
        17:30 Done closing, go home and be with my son until he sleeps at 20:30
        <br />
        20:30 Relax, play something, read something <br />
        21:30 Preparing to go to bed
      </p>
      <p>
        With this schedule I feel that my mental and physical health is doing
        pretty well! But there's not much time over to improve the café. Some
        days I have some creative energy left after 14:30, and it might be
        empty, so then I make the website or write our newsletter etc etc.
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
        Right now the big project is preparing for and installing the new coffee
        machine, a Uniq Stella 2 Group. Me and my father-in-law are building a
        new counter on which it will stand, and into which we will install a
        milk jug cleaner and a knockbox. :D
      </p>
      <p>
        So far I've been using a La Pavoni Esperto, which I love, but it's not
        great at making multiple coffee drinks simultaneously. With the La
        Pavoni the workflow for a Latte is something like:
      </p>
      <p><img src="/posts/33/la_pavoni.jpg" alt="La Pavoni" /></p>
      <ol>
        <li>Put portafilter on scale, fill it up with 19g coffee</li>
        <li>Grind the coffee</li>
        <li>
          Measure again, make sure it's 18g (the grinder eats some coffee)
        </li>
        <li>
          Release &quot;fake steam&quot; (I have no idea what this is, but I do
          it because the manual told me)
        </li>
        <li>Insert the portafilter into the La Pavoni</li>
        <li>Raise the lever, hold it up for at least 10 seconds</li>
        <li>
          Lower the lever until I feel resistance, hold it still for 3 seconds
        </li>
        <li>Raise the lever for 3 seconds</li>
        <li>
          Push down with 5-8 bars resistance (depending on grind size) for 30
          seconds
        </li>
        <li>Pour the resulting espresso into a large glass</li>
        <li>Pour milk in a jug 225ml</li>
        <li>Steam the milk, takes about 60 seconds I think</li>
        <li>Pour the milk into the glass with the espresso</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        This process I think takes about 5 minutes, possibly more. It's also
        extremely serial. I can't do any of these steps at the same time that I
        do anything else. It also takes longer to steam with the La Pavoni than
        a bigger machine, at least that's what I've heard. I think it has to do
        with the pressure of the machine. La Pavoni has 0.5-1 bar pressure in
        the tank, while the Uniq Stella has 9 bars. I think that means more
        heat, and it definitely means more steam going out into the milk faster.
      </p>
      <p><img src="/posts/33/unic_stella.webp" alt="Unic Stella" /></p>
      <p>
        With the Uniq Stella, I'll also be able to condense step 4-9 into a
        single step 4: press the button. And while that button has been pressed,
        I can do other tasks, like grind beans for another drink. It should also
        be possible to place milk jugs in a way that allows the 30 seconds of
        steaming to happen while I do other things. So I can potentially go from
        1 drink in 5 minutes, to 2 drinks in 2-3 minutes! I don't know what sort
        of speed I'll be able to achieve, but it's definitely going to be
        faster. :)

      <h1 id="illegible"><a href="#illegible">Illegible</a></h1>
      <p>
        I don't like pushing myself. I feel like it's very common when I push
        myself that:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>I get burnt out (more or less clinically)</li>
        <li>The result isn't worth it</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        When you add to that that everything is meaningless, we get a question:
      </p>
      <p>
        Is it better to spend a meaningless existence feeling good or feeling
        bad?
      </p>
      <p>
        I still remember one time in school. I think I was 13 years old. I was
        at home, working on an assignment in natural science. After having
        gotten bad grades on assignments multiple times due to illegible hand
        writing, I put a lot of effort into writing properly. This was painful
        for me. Writing hurt my hand a lot, so my method was generally to write
        as quickly as possible as to lessen the time I had to feel pain.
      </p>
      <p>
        But this time I wanted to write properly. So I endured the pain. I wrote
        carefully and slowly, while my hand started hurting more and more. I
        tend to have trouble remembering things, but I do remember finishing the
        assignment, and writing down what song I listened to at that moment.
        Somehow I had to mark down the occasion, since now I really had fought
        for something.
      </p>
      <p>
        When handing in the assignment, I even asked my teacher: &quot;Is this
        legible?&quot; He replied: &quot;Yes.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
        A few days passed, and I got the assignment back with the grade. I just
        got the usual passing grade, with a note: &quot;illegible&quot;.

        I like to have a feeling of flow when I code. The best I've felt
        generally is using Clojure. Here are the main things I think helps
        feeling flow with Clojure:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          unrestricted live coding with a repl
          <ul>
            <li>
              I could rewrite clojure.core (the standard library) while my
              application was running. that power is very useful when
              experimenting and modifying functions and trying them again. you
              can set up your state in a perfect way for your experiment, then
              modify the function until it outputs what you expect.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  this is possible with TDD as well, but sometimes it can be
                  hard/take a long time to set up the state necessary for TDD
                  (maybe the state is hard to serialize), making it more
                  practical to just run your application, make it go into the
                  state you want (e.g. in a game, run to the place where you
                  want to try something), then run/modify/run the function until
                  it does the right thing
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      an alternative solution to repl'ing here is just having
                      all state be serializeable and have a super fast compiler.
                      I believe that setup would be hard to discern from
                      repl'ing. this is probably how I'd do it with a compiled
                      language :)
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              if you don't understand what the above means, it just means that
              you can modify your program while it is running. say you have an
              animation that you want to tweak, let's say the bounce of a
              button. let's also say that the button is only visible after you
              have filled in some state (e.g. a submit button that won't bounce
              until you have filled out a form). with live coding, you can
              modify the code, and instantly see how the animation changes,
              while the form is still filled in. you can also &quot;ask
              questions&quot;, i.e. write code to query the state (&quot;what
              name is currently inputted?&quot; or &quot;does the email fulfil
              <code>correct-email?</code>?&quot;). I still haven't figured out a
              nice way to express this succintly. it might be something that
              cannot be told, only shown. if that is the case,
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1FMk7Js2Rw"
                >here's one place where I try to show it</a
              >
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          immutable data
          <ul>
            <li>
              it just turns code cleaner, in general. in my current C project I
              modify pointers which in hindsight has turned a lot of my project
              to mush
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a

          <ul>
            <li>
              the elegance of paredit is being able to think about code in a
              more abstract way. being able to flip two branches of an
              <code>if</code>, or changing the order of two elements in a
              vector, and having those commands use the same hotkey is just so
              nice when you get into it (<code>transpose-sexps</code> (this is
              emacs, not paredit, but paredit adds a bunch more -- from vscode's
              perspective it's all paredit))
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          libraries that seldom move
          <ul>
            <li>
              clojure has a culture of adding onto rather than modifying. Rich
              Hickey has a
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyLBGkS5ICk"
                >good talk</a
              >
              on why modifying your functions often means breaking them.
            </li>
            <li>this leads to more calm when updating libraries</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        What is the problem with Clojure then? Well, it's on Java. And Java
        makes it harder to build games. It's slow (and Clojure is often even
        slower), it's harder to build iOS apps, it's harder to deploy for web
        (especially with the build sizes going up (there is ofc CLJS)), it's
        harder to build for consoles. But my main gripe is that it's slow.
        Immutability doesn't help games all that much either, and writing
        mutable code in Clojure tends to feel a bit wonky.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm not saying it can't be done. I've made
        <a href="http://animal-capital.surge.sh">a game</a> on CLJS, and have
        played around with graphics libraries and Clojure. I just feel that it
        isn't a natural fit. If you could show me a code editor written on Java
        that doesn't feel sluggish and doesn't eat &gt;100mb ram, maybe I could
        be persuaded otherwise. Because I feel that it's the underlying platform
        that's the main problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        C on the other hand, doesn't have these problems. It feels very natural
        to interact with graphic libraries, and it's small and fast. Very nice.
        But it's instead often painful to code in. But in this case, I'm not
        convinced that the underlying platform is the problem. I think here
        there's space to fix the language instead.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, repl'ing is impractical in C, but I think you could fix
        that.The OS lets you modify your program while running, thanks to
        <code>dlopen</code> -- loading dll / .so-files during runtime. Immutable
        data is nice for flow, but not necessary for games (though you probably
        want to peek a lot at some of the benefits you get from immutable data,
        like being able to express that values put into a function doesn't
        change, like non-<code>mut</code> parameters in that unnameable
        oxidizing language). Paredit? Just make the language a lisp and it'll be
        fine. Libraries that seldom move? This is more of a culture thing, but I
        believe focusing on functions over classes help, since functions are
        easier to add more of. E.g. you could update a library by adding a
        <code>foo2</code> rather than modifying <code>foo</code>, then let the
        user of the library either use the old one or the new one. No breakage.
      </p>
      <p>
        So this is what I'm trying to do with
        <a href="https://github.com/saikyun/vajer">vajer</a>. Sadly I'm
        currently coding it in C, and I'm not a very good C programmer, so I am
        a bit stuck. So instead of trying to solve it, I'm writing some more
        blog posts.

        Type inferencing in
        <a href="https://github.com/saikyun/vajer">Vajer</a> works now!
      </p>
      <p>This means code like this:</p>
      <pre><code class="language-clojure">(defn move_up
  [map mapw maph]
  (var pos (get_pos map mapw maph 0))
  (if (&gt;= (- pos mapw) 0)
    (move map pos (- pos mapw))))
</code></pre>
      <p>Is compiled to</p>
      <pre><code class="language-c">void move_up(int* map, int mapw, int maph) {
  int gensym54;
  gensym54 = get_pos(map, mapw, maph, 0);

  int pos = gensym54;

  int gensym56;
  int gensym57;
  gensym57 = (pos - mapw);

  gensym56 = (gensym57 &gt;= 0);

  if (gensym56) {
    int gensym59;

    move(map, pos, gensym59);

        It's of course hideously untested and the error messages are terrible,

      </h1>
      <p>Last time I wrote about Vajer, I had to write if like this:</p>
      <pre><code>(defn move-up
  [map :char*
    mapw :int
    maph :int] :int
  (var pos :int (- (strchr map 0) map))
  (if (&gt;= (- pos mapw) 0)
    (do
      (put map pos 1)
      (put map (- pos mapw) 0)
      0))
)
    </code></pre>
      <p>
        Because it couldn't deal with void. Also it could <em>only</em> deal
        with ints.
      </p>
      <p>Now that's fixed! The same function now looks like this:</p>
      <pre><code>(defn move_up
  [map :char*
    mapw :int
    maph :int] :void
  (var rrr :char* (strchr map 0))
  (var pos :int (- rrr map))
  (if (&gt;= (- pos mapw) 0)
    (move map pos (- pos mapw))))
    </code></pre>
      <p>
        Now that I look at it, it seems some other things changed, but the
        important one is that I don't need :int return type on the function, and
        the if doesn't need the do-block and returning an int!

      </h1>
      <p>
        As is usually the case when I am tired but get time to lay still in bed
        all morning (not that common with a 6 year old son), my mind starts
        visiting interesting places.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I am stressed, it's sadly mostly about work. But lately, it seems
        that those processes have slowed down. Perhaps because I got fired from
        the last job I was stressed at. My current work feels more manageable,
        and I'm able to exercise 5 times per week.
      </p>
      <p>
        This morning, one of the interesting things that popped up was the
        question &quot;would I hire myself?&quot;. Something struck a chord when
        I &quot;heard&quot; this, and I think it's sort of an interesting
        question to explore.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since the economy was rough in the last company I worked for, I got the
        &quot;ephiphany&quot; of: for every crown you get paid, you should earn
        your company two crowns. If you can't do that, you're probably not
        working in an economically sustainable way.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since then (a full two months ago) I've started to ask myself this
        before considering working with someone: will I bring more than I cost?
      </p>
      <p>
        I think the way I'm working right now, that's definitely true. I believe
        I am adding a lot toward the goals of the company, which are also things
        people are willing to pay for.
      </p>
      <p>
        The &quot;would I hire myself?&quot; question is a bit broader though.
        Because with that framing, one gets a bit of company culture, morality
        and personality traits into the mix.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've struggled a lot with reporting time, because if you judge me by
        &quot;how well do I sit in front of a computer 40 hours per week and
        have the job's code open in my editor?&quot; I'm a terrible programmer.
        I have a kid who gets sick often, I'm a feminist which means I want to
        share household work (and there are hints that
        <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10508-022-02397-2"
          >this is good for the relationship</a
        >
        as well (which seems kind of obvious but also seems like many men don't
        bother)) some of which includes dropping off my son at preschool and
        making sure dinner is ready. So if the above criteria is how I'd hire
        me, I would say no. Never. I'd just hire someone fresh out of college
        (or still in), give them 50% of what I ask for, and they could chug
        along merrily with all of their youthful energy and boundless time.
      </p>
      <p>
        So what I've done then, though not stated explicitly, is something like
        asking myself, &quot;ok, so in what situation <em>would</em> I hire
        myself in?&quot;. What I came up with is something like this:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>I need to be able to take care of my son when he's sick</li>
        <li>
          I need to drop him off at 09:00 and be done with work 17:00, and I
          need to exercise and eat lunch inbetween
        </li>
        <li>I need to be able to have tired days</li>
        <li>
          I don't want to deal with people planning that I should do x thing on
          precisely y day, which always gets wrecked because of someone getting
          sick
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        What I came up with then, is that I should work at most 4 hours per day.
        That would mean I have 8 hours - 4 hours = 4 hours to be lazy and
        exercise. What this also means is that if he's sick one day, and my wife
        takes care of him the next, it's at least feasible (if hard) to work a
        bit longer and catch up, whereas with an expected &quot;8 hour in front
        of screen per day&quot;, catching up and doing 16 hours is impossible
        for me.
      </p>
      <p>
        With this in mind, I can proudly answer the question of &quot;how well
        do I sit in front of a computer <strong>20</strong> hours per week and
        have the job's code open in my editor?&quot; and say &quot;very
        well!&quot;. Even with life's hiccups, I can do that pretty sustainably.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, what I haven't even started getting into is what other questions I
        could ask myself, which are a different way of looking at the problem,
        questions that would make me look better than less experienced
        developers.
      </p>
      <p>
        &quot;How well do you manage unclear specifications?&quot; No problem.
        <br />
        &quot;Do you enjoy mentoring others?&quot; Yes! <br />
        &quot;Can we put you alone in a room with a client and you'll figure
        everything out and deliver a product without essentially any
        hand-holding?&quot; Hell yeah! I love talking to clients and users and
        all that stuff. I love making sure users enjoy using the tools I build
        for them. :D
      </p>
      <p>
        With these criterions, and still having fulfilled the nebolous &quot;can
        you sit in front of computer x amount of hours&quot; for a high enough
        number of x, I can proudly say:
      </p>
      <p>&quot;Yes! I would hire myself!&quot;</p>

      <p>
        I often dive into things head first. I like to fix problems, code as
        quickly as possible while I'm still hype, I hate waiting. I really
        <em>really</em> hate waiting. Because it's like spending my working time
        doing nothing. Then when it's time to do something I'm already tired
        and/or bored.
      </p>
      <p>So I tend to do things one bit at the time.</p>
      <p>
        When I started working on my text editor
        <a href="https://github.com/saikyun/freja">freja</a>, I didn't sketch
        out <code>freja-frp</code>, <code>freja-layout</code> and
        <code>textarea</code>. I just started with the goal of &quot;implement
        all interactions that are in the Chrome implementation of
        <code>&lt;textarea&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;</code>&quot;.
      </p>
      <p>
        This turned out to be a great goal. It's very clear what should be
        there. Everything in the Chrome textarea. And it's very clear what
        should not be there. Everything that's not in the Chrome textarea.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another helpful part was that I constantly communicated my progress with
        a close friend. So even on non-productive days I could complain about
        the problems I faced. I can't remember if he did, but I'm sure he
        brought up interactions I didn't think about at first, like triple
        clicking or certain funny word wrapping aspects.
      </p>
      <p>
        After two months or so, I was at
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReUczDAWLfI"
          >this stage (youtube, 1min)</a
        >. At that point I even managed to get some extra stuff in, like syntax
        highlighting. And a little easter egg for those with a watchful eye. :)
      </p>
      <p>
        Still, after those two months, I still didn't know what was ahead of me.
        I had just worked merrily in a way that suited me. I had this vague
        sense of what an ideal text editor should be, but I didn't say that I
        must plan everything out ahead.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, about a year later, working in a similar way, with smaller
        problems to solve each week, I released what I call the notepad-complete
        version of Freja. You could essentially do everything you can in
        notepad, and then some (live coding in the editor!).
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe I would never have gone this far if I had tried to plan this
        process ahead. And this is for a whole text editor. I wonder how many
        ideas are snuffed out before getting the chance to burn brightly,
        because of inaction.

      </h1>
      <p>
        I just read
        <a href="https://underjord.io/complex-systems-all-the-way-down.html"
          >this blogpost by lawik</a
        >. lawik is a fellow Kodsnackare who apparently has a really cool blog.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've heard that it's good content to take someone else's stuff and
        comment on it, so I figured I'd do that.
      </p>
      <p>
        lawik describes how one can zoom into problems infinitely. Like in the
        following paragraph.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          When a student asks me “What are your thoughts on MongoDB?” the answer
          is only simple if I lie. I know some people like it. I have heard
          enough to distrust it. The answer “Just use Postgres” isn’t exactly
          right, “It’s probably fine” feels dishonest and if I add “but I’d
          never choose it for anything” that’s hardly helpful. There is enormous
          context and choosing what to bring into a learning person’s world is
          genuinely difficult.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        I've done a little bit of teaching myself, and have struggled with
        similar problems. I myself love diving into weird little details, like
        how Axl's crouching kick can avoid Sol's massive overhead Bandit Bringer
        in Guilty Gear Xrd. Or how in Clojure you can access private functions,
        like <code>clojure.core/into1</code> with the invocation
        <code>@#'clojure.core/into1</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        These are things obviously not relevant to a beginner, but on the scale
        of &quot;this is how you call a function&quot; to &quot;this is how you
        modify core functions&quot; one always have to come up with an answer
        to: &quot;do I explain this, make some vague analogue up, or ignore
        it?&quot;.
      </p>
      <p>
        It doesn't help that you often have to do this while solving your own
        problems as well.
      </p>
      <p>For me, the two things that have helped me teach others are:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Dedicate time to teaching</li>
        <li>Teaching in a workplace setting means working together</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        The most succesful situation I've had was when I described an interface
        for a Wave Manager in a game. It was meant to keep track of the number
        of enemies, and when the next wave of enemies should spawn after all
        enemies in the current wave had died.
      </p>
      <p>So I would write something like:</p>
      <pre><code class="language-c#">// 1. count number of enemies
// 2. if count is zero, start a timer
// 3. if timer is complete, call SpawnNextWave
void CheckNewWaveStart() {

}
    </code></pre>
      <p>
        And then I'd do the same for <code>SpawnNextWave</code>, and for the
        next function that popped up, etc etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then I said that he should implement the functions, while I work on
        another related but not super dependent interface.
      </p>
      <p>
        After doing that for an afternoon, he said it was the best work day he
        had had so far. So it worked great!
      </p>
      <p>I think what was helpful about this was:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          His focus was more clear. He was not supposed to design an overarching
          structure, but was instead supposed to solve more zoomed-in problems.
        </li>
        <li>
          He was contributing. It was stuff that was crucial for the game to
          work.
        </li>
        <li>
          I could work on other things, related but not dependent, so I wasn't
          as slowed down as I would have been if we worked on the exact same
          thing or wildly different things. This helped my productivity and
          lessened context-switching.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        I have more things to say about the blog post, but this already turned
        out pretty long, so that's it for today.
      </p>
      <p>Thanks lawik for sharing your thoughts.</p>

        Somehow I managed to get a game of some sort working in my lisp. :D You
        can move around, collect money, and most importantly: die.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are some interesting quirks. For example, you can only use
        <code>if</code> as the last expression in a <code>defn</code>, or inside
        <code>while</code>. If you do it inside a <code>while</code> though, you
        can only use <code>if</code> as a statement, and not an expression. Hm.
      </p>
      <pre><code>(var lul :int 0)
    (while (&lt; lul 1)
      (if (&amp;&amp; (== 0 (in map to))
              (&lt; to (* mapw maph)))
        (do (printf &quot;YOU DIED\n&quot;)
            (set dead 1)))
    (set lul 1))
    </code></pre>
      <p>So there's some of this littered around.</p>
      <p>
        What's nice is that now I have an example program, stored in git. So now
        I can go through various pain points (and I've written some down in
        <a
          href="https://github.com/saikyun/vajer/blob/main/QnA.md#todo-this-code-breaks-because-of-if-wanting-to-set-a-parents-defns-return-value"
          >QnA.md</a
        >). Then over time I can compare my progress to this initial program,
        and see how much cleaner newer versions of vajer will be. :)

      <p>Some reflections:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I have a vague sense I need to deal with memory management soon, but
          it hasn't come up yet really
        </li>
        <li>
          Atm I kinda copy <a href="janet">https://janet-lang.org</a>'s style,
          which might be good but maybe I need to think about some things
        </li>
        <li>Probably will want to be able to define structs soon</li>
        <li>
          I want macros soon too, like defining <code>(++ x)</code> instead of
          <code>(set x (+ x 1))</code> (assuming I keep janet style)
        </li>
        <li>I feel like I can do a lot already!</li>

      <h1 id="untitled"><a href="#untitled">&lt;untitled&gt;</a></h1>
      <p>I just don't know what to write about.</p>
      <p>My mind is kind of spinning, due to lack of sleep and things.</p>
      <p>
        Right now I'm waiting in the smell of stone grilled bread for my gluten
        free pizza and my wife's vegetarian avocado salad to be made by the men
        behind the counter.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm trying gluten free food at the moment, and for the last two weeks or
        so. I can't remember if I wrote this already, but if I forgot it, I'm
        sure you did as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first inkling that I might have some problem with gluten was the way
        I felt after eating Max's plant beef burger, which I'm pretty sure is
        made with wheat. After eating one of those bad boy's I was knocked out
        for an hour or three.
      </p>
      <p>
        It has felt very inconsistent though, like I didn't feel affected when
        eating bread or pizza etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        But after one tired day too many, I figured I need to try something. I
        can't remember exactly what made me try gluten free, but I think one
        part of it was vaguely remembering my mom saying felt she felt much
        better when not eating bread and stuff.
      </p>
      <p>So I just tried it.</p>
      <p>
        The main difference in my life has been going from 4+ sandwiches per day
        to 0. I've had to cook more stuff for breakfast, like eggs and pancakes
        using almond flour.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was kind of funny, I had no real clue what almond flour was. I
        thought it was some strange stuff made in a lab for gluten allergic
        people.
      </p>
      <p>But then I read the back.</p>
      <p>It's made out of almonds.</p>

      <h1 id="back-exercises"><a href="#back-exercises">Back Exercises</a></h1>
      <p>
        Today was a pretty strange day, so here are my top three back exercises.
        Please be careful and listen to your body, I have no clue if these are
        for you, so try them at your own peril. I got them from a physical
        therapist though, and I believe they are fairly gentle.
      </p>
      <p>I don't know their names, so I'll just name them something.</p>
      <h2>The band puller</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Put a rubber band under your right foot</li>
        <li>Stand straight</li>
        <li>Put your right hand forward, at the level of your hips</li>
        <li>
          With the hand in this position, adjust the band so that it is just
          starting to stretch
        </li>
        <li>
          Pull your hand and the band upwards, so that your hand pointing
          straight forward, at the level of your shoulder
        </li>
        <li>Slowly move your hand down to the starting position</li>
        <li>
          Repeat 5-10 times, then change hand and foot. Do the same, and repeat
          for a total of 15-30 times per side
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>Progression: Use a rubber band with more resistance</p>
      <h2>Super Person</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Stand on all fours, hands under shoulders, knees under your hips
        </li>
        <li>
          Lift your right arm, hold it straight forward, in level with your
          head, for a breath, then put it back down
        </li>
        <li>
          Repeat with your left arm, then right, etc, for a total of 5-15
          repetitions per arm
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Progression: Increase the number and length of your breaths Next level:
        Straighten your left leg, point it straight back, when you lift your
        right hand
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <h2>Spine-into-floor-pusher</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Lie down on your back, with your feet a bit away from your butt, so
          that your legs make a sort of triangle
        </li>
        <li>
          Push your back into the floor. You'll want to use your
          &quot;core&quot; more than your stomach, you can verify that you're
          doing this by feeling right above your pelvis, especially to the
          sides. You should feel muscles tense here
        </li>
        <li>Hold that position for 5 breaths, then release</li>
        <li>Repeat 10-20 times</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        <img

          alt="Spine-into-floor-pusher"
        />
      </p>
      <p>
        Progression: Keep one leg straight forward, and lift it ever so slightly
        above the ground. The lower you keep your leg (without touching the
        ground), the harder it will be
      </p>
      <p>
        These exercises help me a lot when my back hurts. I hope they can be
        helpful for you as well. :)

      </h1>
      <p>
        I watched a video about art one time, making art, that is. As I remember
        it, the video person said that one problem people can have is that they
        are doubting themselves. And one reason for that doubt is that they know
        a lot, but can only execute a little. This can happen when you watch a
        lot of tutorials on &quot;how to do things&quot; (like art), but don't
        spend enough time experimenting with the information you gathered. This
        builds up a huge discrepancy between what you know, and what you can do.
      </p>
      <p>
        The video person gave a concrete ratio, I can't quite remember, but it
        was something like watching 20 minutes of art tutorials should be enough
        for at least 5 hours of practise, or maybe it was 20 hours.
      </p>
      <p>
        I wonder, with tech, if the ratio isn't even worse. People are still
        debating SOLID principles, while I still feel pretty undecided about it.
        I haven't put in enough hours coding using those principles, or without,
        and compared them, to actually have a solid opinion. And I feel this way
        about:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Fibers</li>
        <li>
          Macros (though I'm leaning pretty far into liking them, I have no clue
          about reader macros!?)
        </li>
        <li>
          Logic in configuration files (though I think it's heresy, I can't
          really say why in a way that would convince anyone)
        </li>
        <li>Exceptions</li>
        <li>
          &quot;Functional programming&quot; (I can't even define it -- I'm
          pretty sure I like <code>map</code>/<code>filter</code>/<code
            >reduce</code
          >
          though, but I'm pretty sure I don't like allocating functions each
          time they are run)
        </li>
        <li>for–loops</li>
        <li>Iterators</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        And this is just basic stuff. How about which way to structure your
        code? What language to choose? Static vs dynamic typing? (You aren't
        allowed to have an opinion on this unless you've tried Idris.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Okay, so, yeah. Whatever. This technical stuff is kinda getting in the
        way of the point I want to make. Which is this.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think it's good to find a balance between input and output. If I have
        too much input, I'll just become an armchair expert, and those don't get
        anything done and everyone think they're annoying.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've become more aware of this problem while trying to use the GTD
        tools. Like capturing all ideas and potential tasks. Now I try to listen
        to a podcast episode, or watch a talk. But just the amount of things I
        write down gets exhausting. There are so many good ideas in the world,
        and so much to explore. But I already have a ton of things to do and
        explore! I don't really need more ideas at the moment! I just need to
        output more. And in the meantime, I'll try to find more meaningless ways
        to rest, less draining than watching talks or listening to podcasts
        where my brain just fills up with more stuff I don't have time to try.

      </h1>
      <p>
        I wonder how much less people with ADHD would suffer if they got
        sufficient exercise.
      </p>
      <p>I feel both anxiety and sleeplessness decrease when I exercise.</p>
      <p>
        I read that when children get to exercise that got their hearts going as
        little as 5 minutes in the morning, before classes, they were better at
        focusing.
      </p>
      <p>
        I wonder how many get medicated when maybe they should just get a chance
        to exercise more.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm sure some people need medication, I just wonder if there are enough
        economic interests in getting people to move around more.
      </p>
      <p>
        My back pain is eradicated after I jog/walk/jog for a bit. It's very
        nice.
      </p>
      <p>I'm happy I can move more now.</p>

        <a href="#compiling-lisp-to-c">Compiling Lisp to C</a>
      </h1>
      <p>
        Today I got some time to work a bit more on the compiler. It's been a
        two week break, mostly because of focusing on GTD stuff, having meetings
        with work people last week, my wife going to Stockholm for a couple of
        days, my wife being sick, me trying to actually do the stuff I wrote in
        my Orthodox GTD Journal.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm pretty happy though, because my home is surprisingly clean, and I
        finally ordered a portable laptop stand that I've been wanting for
        years. I've also bought a Planck EZ from a nice guy / super star
        (perhaps most famous for his
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy0aCDmgnxg">shorts video</a>).
        When it has arrived I'll proudly take a photo of my glorious set up. Did
        I mention I bought wooden wrist support as well?
      </p>
      <p>
        So, with all that sort of figured out, I finally felt the peace of mind
        to sit down with my lisp again.
      </p>
      <p>When I last left of, I had almost fulfilled the goal of compiling</p>
      <pre><code>(defn fac [n]
  (if (&lt;= n 1)
    1
    (* n (fac (- n 1)))))
</code></pre>
      <p>to</p>
      <pre><code>int fac(n) {
    int res;
    if (n &lt;= 1) {
        res = 1;
    } else {
        res = (n * fac(n - 1));
    }
    return res;
}
    </code></pre>
      <p>The stuff that was missing was:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Figuring out what should get a <code>;</code> at the end (e.g. not
          <code>if</code>)
        </li>
        <li>Calling user defined functions</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        I fixed 1. pretty easily, thanks to having both thought and talked about
        the problem with my friend. 2. was pretty easy to, for now I just assume
        people fill in the right names for everything and try to call it.
      </p>
      <p>
        After that, I got it to compile it to C and run the resulting source in
        the same process using libttc. Very cool! :D
      </p>
      <p>
        I did know there were some problems though. So after the initial
        success, I wrote some down:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Types (right now only <code>int</code> is supported)</li>
        <li>While-loops</li>
        <li>Structs</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I decided to tackle types first, and thanks to the great resource in
        janet's
        <a
          href="https://github.com/janet-lang/jpm/blob/476cbebbb08e92032ca6ae0bb842c199fe8edd3f//jpm/cgen.janet"
          >cgen</a
        >, I figured I could just use explicit types for now, in the ast having
        the form of <code>(int num)</code>, so a defn would look like:
        <code>(defn add [(int x) (int y)] int)</code>. I thought I could make it
        look a bit nicer in my source, so I decided on this syntax for now:
      </p>
      <pre><code>(defn strlen-plus-n
  [str :string num :int] :int
  (+ num (strlen str)))
    </code></pre>
      <p>
        Of course, the goal is to add type inference later, but since the C ast
        will need the types explicitly, to make sure that worked first, it felt
        easiest to start with explicit types.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyway, after hacking just a bit, mainly changing how
        <code>defn</code> ast nodes are transformed (specifically the
        arguments), I managed to compile the above to:
      </p>
      <pre><code class="language-c">int strlen_plus_n(char* str, int num) {
  return num + strlen(str);
}
    </code></pre>
      <p>Yay! :D</p>
      <p>
        Soon I might actually be able to compile enough C to write a little
        program. :)

        <a href="#first-day-of-work">First Day of Work</a>
      </h1>
      <p>Today I had my first day of work. Doing the new work.</p>
      <p>
        It felt good to know that I can work and get an income again. It&#39;s
        nice doing not much at all, but even nicer to do a little bit of
        something, and then nothing at all.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today nothing at all meant getting home early to make surprise dinner
        for my wife. She seems happy. My son is with his grandpa. It&#39;s
        strange how rare a walk to the library together with my wife can be.
      </p>
      <p>
        I don&#39;t understand how you&#39;re meant to work a lot, and have
        children, and take care of your body. Yesterday I managed to reach my
        goal of jog/walk/jogging for 30 minutes, which felt great! But I would
        have had a hard time doing it if I weren&#39;t able to spend part of my
        work day exercising. Evening time is so chaotic and prone to random
        events, that it&#39;s hard to make a habit of anything, at least for me.
      </p>
      <p>
        So I&#39;m very grateful that I&#39;m able to take care of my body
        better.
      </p>
      <p>
        I&#39;ve heard that police and firemen get to work out during work time.
        I wonder why the same isn&#39;t true for programmers?

        Today we purged my son's stuffed animals. I wanted to write about the
        fun system I came up with, with dice to rate which animals he liked the
        most. He seemed to like assigning numbers to the animals.
      </p>
      <p>But in the end, he still cried.</p>

      <h1 id="fruits-of-gtd"><a href="#fruits-of-gtd">Fruits of GTD</a></h1>
      <p>
        Yesterday evening I took the time to sit down with my action-list,
        specifically the one called &quot;At Computer&quot;. And I finally felt
        relief.
      </p>
      <p>
        But relief isn't the right kind of word. In the GTD Fast seminars, David
        Allen talks about how you don't think, and just do. And I actually felt
        that way. I just plowed through action after action, and when I was
        done, I had scratched out over 20 entries, some of which were pretty big
        (in my mind), like doing taxes. Others had been needing tending since
        august last year, but were now made progress on in minutes.
      </p>
      <p>So yeah, that was pretty cool.</p>
      <p>
        I don't have that much to say about it, other than I felt that the
        earlier steps really helped turning the productive phase super
        productive. Less figuring out what to do, more doing.
      </p>
      <p>
        This post feels super boring, but I'm gonna practice publishing boring
        things as well. Because I might be wrong.

      <h1 id="catching-up"><a href="#catching-up">Catching Up</a></h1>
      <p>
        Today I finally got the time to sit down and go through my inbox. My
        book is now filled with tasks and actions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Trying to get to this point has made me think a bit about doing things,
        and time.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's interesting how much time is spent doing things that doesn't feel
        like you're doing anything. For example, today I woke up at ~8:00 and
        the clock was 11 or so before I felt I could sit down with my lists. The
        time inbetween felt like I did nothing, but what I actually did was:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Get up</li>
        <li>Make breakfast for my son</li>
        <li>
          Send a photo of me holding Way of Kings that arrived during the night
          (my son took the package in because he has been hype for the latest
          volume of Handbok för Superhjältar) to my friend who recommended it to
          me
        </li>
        <li>Poop</li>
        <li>Jog and buy saturday candy</li>
        <li>Shower</li>
        <li>Make breakfast for me and my wife</li>
        <li>Eat and talk with my son and wife</li>
        <li>Clear out my desk</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        And I'm probably forgetting details, like getting dressed, fetching a
        towel, making new sections for my action book.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's just so much stuff! No wonder I feel pressed for time sometimes. It
        probably doesn't help that I can take some time switching between
        different contexts. My wife says it's because of autism, I claim it's
        because of being burnt out. Maybe we're both right. :)
      </p>
      <p>
        Now my inbox is empty! Or, well, almost. I noticed I had another note in
        my pocket, but that one doesn't count because it wasn't in my inbox yet.
        So good enough!
      </p>
      <p>Now I need to find time to actually do the actions.</p>

        Yesterday was an interesting day. After a bit of a struggle finding a
        nice place to work, I suddenly got two offers on the same day! One
        working with a game made in cljs + react native, which is kinda silly
        how good of a fit it is for me. However, the other offer was more
        stable, paid more (i.e. allowing me to work less, 15h/week(!!!)), and
        feels very meaningful.
      </p>
      <p>So I chose the latter.</p>
      <p>
        I think it's funny how common it is for me that when I struggle with
        something, and try to find a way out, it is often the case that after a
        time of panic, two solutions arise at the same time. It has happened
        multiple times with both love interests and jobs. Maybe it's a way to
        ensure that you suffer a bit as well, even in your time of luck? :)
      </p>
      <p>
        I feel a bit bad for the cljs guy though, so if you are or know of
        someone interested in cljs + react native + gamedev, please contact me.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm very grateful that things seem to be turning out smoothly. Now I'll
        be in a good shape both economically and stress-wise (15h / w!!!) to
        receive our second son in august. ^_^

      <h1 id="day-4-on-gtd"><a href="#day-4-on-gtd">Day 4 on GTD</a></h1>
      <p>
        Since starting to note everything down, as per Orthodox GTD Dogma, I'm
        realizing I have way more obligations than I thought. In a single day I
        noted over 20 things for my inbox plus email plus texts. And I don't
        even have a job!
      </p>
      <p>A sample of things in my inbox:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Dinosaurs (for the RPG session I'm planning for my son &amp; wife, we
          recently made characters for the
          <a
            href="https://handbokforsuperhjaltar.se/butik/spel/rollspel/handbok-for-superhjaltar-rollspelet/"
            >Handbok för Superhjältar</a
          >
          role playing game)
        </li>
        <li>Check Twitter</li>
        <li>Remove rug from balcony</li>
        <li>Contact son's friend's mom to plan playdate</li>
        <li>Brett Victor, Future of Code and Learning Programming</li>
        <li>Sun lamp</li>
        <li>
          Check SMS from my wife (I accidentally read it but I need to remember
          to put it in my inbox)
        </li>
        <li>
          Get Megaman Legends for a let's play that I'm doing with two friends
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>It's just a lot of stuff!!</p>
      <p>
        And I have even more already that has undergone the holy ritual of
        &quot;processing&quot;, which means they are deciphered into
        &quot;Goal&quot; and &quot;Action&quot;, and are under categories such
        as &quot;At Home&quot; or &quot;By Computer&quot; or
        &quot;Projects&quot;.
      </p>
      <p>
        Oh great, I just found another note. 10 more things, so 30 for today.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm a bit happy to get all these obligations down on paper, but I also
        notice I feel stress that it takes so much time to just process all of
        these notes. I hope I'll reach a point when there won't be too much new
        stuff, and I can spend a bit more time actually doing some of the
        actions I've written down.

      </h1>
      <p>
        I think there are more people than me who are good at getting used to
        bad things.
      </p>
      <p>
        I used to code lisp in emacs, and what's amazing about it, is that you
        can use
        <a href="http://danmidwood.com/content/2014/11/21/animated-paredit.html"
          >Paredit</a
        >
        (and other structural editing tools, like those built into emacs) which
        let's you treat the code like a branching road where you can move towns
        and lakes around, rather than erase individual characters. The most
        obvious example in my mind are languages where <code>,</code> separates
        &quot;things&quot;, e.g.:
      </p>
      <pre><code>int sum(int curr, int acc)
</code></pre>
      <p>
        In this situation, if you want to switch the place of
        <code>int curr</code> and <code>int acc</code>, you have to do this
        awkward dance of selecting <code>acc</code>, cutting it, moving the
        cursor to <code>curr</code>, paste it, select <code>curr</code>, cut it,
        move the cursor back to where <code>acc</code> used to be, paste. If
        there were no <code>,</code>, at least you could just select and cut the
        whole <code>int acc</code>, move the cursor to right after
        <code>(</code>, and paste, hit space, and remove the trailing space at
        the end. There are many variants on this, and if you're anything like
        me, you notice when these awkward things happen. And there's not really
        a clean solution.
      </p>
      <p>

          >That's not true in lisp.</a
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        You just do a single command, <code>transpose-sexp</code> (preferably
        bound to a hotkey). And when you want to move multiple expressions that
        are in the same block, let's say you have code like this:
        <code>(curr :int acc :int)</code>, then at least you can stand in the
        middle, hit <code>Ctrl+K</code> which cuts until right before the
        closing <code>)</code>, then move to the beginning of the expression,
        then paste. At least you don't have to fiddle with selecting single
        characters.
      </p>
      <p>
        But I've gotten used to not having it, after sitting in C-based
        languages for more than a year. And it's very sad.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course there are a lot worse things to get used to, like depression,
        abuse and plastic accumulating in our nature.
      </p>
      <p>
        Still though, I wonder if there's a connection. If you allow yourself to
        get used to one thing that you can affect, but don't. Do you get better
        at getting used to bad things?

      <h1 id="productivity"><a href="#productivity">Productivity</a></h1>
      <p>
        I wanted to name this Tired, but I already made that post, so let's do
        something else.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the weekend, I listened to 90% of the second episode of
        <a href="https://synk.fm/podcast/2-en-snurra-varje-dag/">Synk</a>. In
        this episode, Fredrik and Martin talks about productivity and
        productivity tools (like papers and pens and Obsidian). I don't care
        about productivity, I just wanted to listen to them talk about something
        that isn't game development, because I've spent the last 5 years of my
        life listening to game development podcasts.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the things I like about Fredrik is that he tends to question
        things. So when he said he didn't necessarily do Orthodox GTD, but still
        enjoyed
        <a
          href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gtd/comments/b6ok53/gtd_fast_not_sure_how_long_it_will_be_up_for/"
          >these seminars by the author of the GTD book</a
        >, I was intrigued. I want to listen to people talk, and here's a person
        I like hearing talk saying I should listen to this other person talk. So
        I did.
      </p>
      <p>
        First, the speaker (David Allen), feels very chill. I thought he'd be a
        stuffy business person, something I felt when trying to listen to Eat
        That Frog (some other productivity book thing). So it's just enjoyable
        to listen to him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Secondly, his focus on being lazy, and that you should be able to enjoy
        all of life, not just work, made me feel that maybe he has something
        sensible to say.
      </p>
      <p>
        So I kept listening for a bit while jog/walk/jogging today (maybe half
        an hour), and I'm still feeling &quot;nah, I don't need this
        productivity stuff, my memory is doing all right. the important things
        are always in front of me&quot;. But with his comment about
        &quot;collecting notes&quot; still ringing in my ears, I start noticing
        all the little problems at home that I have some intention to solve, and
        have not solved. Here's a sample:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Out of milk</li>
        <li>Three bottles of lotion of which two are almost empty</li>
        <li>I have no job</li>
        <li>Three bags of cardboard that needs to be recycled</li>
        <li>A pot of potato soup has been on the balcony since february</li>
        <li>A horde of bath toys next to the shower that are never used</li>
        <li>
          Plan for working on my son's daycare tomorrow (e.g. eat lunch in time
          (which means buying lunch in time), bring something gluten free to eat
          between lunch and dinner (which means buying something gluten free))
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Of course, all of these things are in front of me from time to time. But
        I don't keep them in mind for when I have time to deal with them. This
        is obvious stuff, but I have felt so anxious about having todo lists
        that I don't have time or energy to go through, that I've convinced
        myself the best solution is to have no list at all. But I'm starting to
        come around to the thought that I might be wrong. Maybe it's better to
        have the lists, and even if I haven't solved everything, at least I can
        think: &quot;well, it's on the list, and when I have time and energy, I
        can go through the list and solve it.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>I don't need to keep it in my mind.</p>

      <h1 id="rest-day"><a href="#rest-day">Rest Day</a></h1>
      <p>Today it is sunday.</p>
      <p>
        For a while, I tried having a rule that I shouldn't code on sundays. I
        had this feeling that I was tiring myself out, and not giving myself
        enough time to recover. Sundays felt very boring, and I was often tired.
        Implementing this rule, it felt worse. Now I had nothing meaningful to
        do. And since I was tired, I had a hard time coming up with things to
        do. But over time, I started to appreciate this tired feeling.
      </p>
      <p>
        As long as I don't fight against it, it's not dangerous. It's just
        there. And since I'm not allowed to code, there's not really that much
        actually hard things to do. I can clean the kitchen even if I feel
        sluggish. I can watch youtube with my son.
      </p>
      <p>
        After getting laid off though, I felt pressure to create a game quickly,
        and tried to spend as much time as possible on it, including sundays. In
        the beginning, it was pretty easy. I got some sort of energy rush after
        being laid off. But then it went as with most projects, after three
        weeks or so, the hype died down. Me and my family got a long bout of
        colds and infections in the middle of it as well, so it wasn't really
        feasible to struggle so hard to create something quickly. My wife also
        commented on that I didn't seem as happy, now that I was working on
        sundays as well again.
      </p>
      <p>
        (In case you're wondering, it was supposed to be a hexagonal,
        <a href="http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php/Berlin_Interpretation"
          >berlin interpretation roguelike</a
        >
        with <a href="https://youtu.be/urL6ZFOXbCA">trains</a>. I played a bit
        of <a href="https://www.cavesofqud.com">Caves of Qud</a> which inspired
        me to try to create something with less graphics and more code. However,
        I quickly ended up having to draw a lot, which meant I spent a lot of
        time not making fun gameplay. I think this helped kill my motivation.)
      </p>
      <p>
        After letting myself just enjoy empty days, rather than forcing myself
        to produce, I've felt that I've started to recover from my last job. I
        think I was more stressed than I realized, and since I experienced burn
        out (with sleeplessness and extreme difficulties concentrating) at my
        last job, I imagine I'm more stress sensitive than most.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've recently managed to jog often as well. I've been wanting to jog for
        about ten years, ever since reading Murakami's
        <a
          href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2195464.What_I_Talk_About_When_I_Talk_About_Running"
          >&quot;What I Talk About When I Talk About Running&quot;</a
        >. I never found a way to do it sustainably though. In the beginning, I
        just tried running for about 10 minutes straight, then increasing by 1-2
        minutes every day. I think I lasted two weeks, then I started getting a
        lot of pain (I think in my knee, but I can't quite remember). I tried
        taking a short break, but it felt like no matter how long my break was,
        the pain instantly came back. Knowing myself as a 22-year old, I don't
        think I had the patience to wait weeks or months, and try again. So I
        quit, for many years. I've tried from time to time after that, but due
        to my
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ehlers%E2%80%93Danlos_syndromes"
          >EDS</a
        >
        various parts of my body are very sensitive, e.g. knees, feet and my
        back.
      </p>
      <p>
        But this year, I think I finally found a combination of things that
        actually work. I'm using
        <a
          href="https://cdn.sportshop.com/catalog/product/580/580/1/0/109747_1.jpg"
          >Hoka shoes</a
        >
        which have bizarrely large soles (I tried
        <a
          href="https://runon.se/images/thumbs/000/0003907_joe-nimble-w-nimbletoes-addict-road-blackout-dam.jpeg"
          >flat shoes with very little soles</a
        >
        before that but it didn't work for me). I'm also doing the
        &quot;Run/Walk/Run&quot; thing, which for me meant in the beginning to
        stretch, walk for 5 minutes, do 10x 20s jog, 40s walk, walk for 5
        minutes. Now I'm up to 22x 30s jog, 30s walk, and I've managed to keep
        it up even after getting sick, which is incredibly motivating for me,
        because getting sick tends to break all my forming habits.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think this newfound ability to jog has helped me a lot in my recovery.
        I sleep well, despite now being completely sleep medication free. I also
        don't get as sensitive to days when I sleep worse. So overall my mood is
        better.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then I ended up listening to the Kodsnack episode mentioned
        <a href="#thought-loops">in my first blog post</a>. And they said people
        should just start blogging. So I did! And all of a sudden my brain
        started connecting things again, I could think more clearly, and deeper
        than I have been able to for a while. So of course I start coding again.
        My motivation got an extreme boost, and now I feel like I have the
        capability to pull through. What's best is that I have no illusion of
        being able to make money of a niche programming language (well, I guess
        <a href="https://ziglang.org/news/announcing-zig-software-foundation/"
          >one can hope</a
        >, but there isn't as much buzz as with games). I believe this helps me
        feel that this is more of a hobby than a job.
      </p>
      <p>
        Still though, I don't want to risk my newfound energy. Therefore I
        resolve to not code on sundays. That way, I will at least have one
        restful day. And I'm also going to try not to write about code on
        sundays. I can write about my feelings about code, but not get into
        technical stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hope you'll also enjoy a restful sunday. :) My and my wife gonna get to
        watch my son's first dance performance, so I know I will!

      <h1 id="time"><a href="#time">Time</a></h1>
      <p>It's hard for me how to know how to spend my time.</p>
      <p>
        Sometimes I feel like I spend too little time with my son. At the same
        time, I think it can be hard to get all the things done while also
        getting time to spend with my son. And even if I get time to spend with
        my son, it can feel hard to find time to spend with my wife. And if I
        get both of those, it's hard to find time to spend with my wife and son
        at the same time. And then someone get's sick while we're at the
        playground. And now we have even less time to go buy food. So they eat
        leftovers, and I boil some rice. But now it's the day after that day,
        and now I have to buy breakfast before I can eat breakfast, and now I
        get less time to spend with my son.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also I spent two hours watching this fascinating lecture about
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ge3aKEmZcqY"
          >performance in programming</a

      <a href="#tired">
        <h1 id="tired">Tired</h1>
      </a>
      <p>
        Yesterday I had seemingly endless amounts of energy. And today I feel
        very tired. If this had been a regular workday, I would have been
        whipping myself over the lack of productivity. Luckily, I'm currently on
        paid leave, so I don't have to worry so much.
      </p>
      <p>Until I start thinking about how I will soon die, of course.</p>
      <p>
        In the face of that, tired days can really feel like a waste. I think
        I've come up with a spell that helps though. What I've thought is
        something like this:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            If you try to get good at something -- let's say drawing -- and it
            takes ten years, but you die after five, is it meaningful?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            If it is not, then you should probably not be drawing. I mean, even
            if you didn't die, you might get injured, or you might get tired of
            drawing, or your life changes in such a way that you can't spend as
            much time on drawing.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Therefore, it must be meaningful, even if we don't get good at it.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            In that case, what happens if you spend half as much time on drawing
            per week, and it would take 20 years to get good at it? The numbers
            are different, but the equation is the same, right? You might die
            after 5 or 10, it doesn't matter really. Even if you die after 1
            day, it must still be meaningful.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        With this in mind, it doesn't matter if you are tired one day, because
        the striving toward getting good at drawing is worth it anyway.
      </p>
      <p>And if it isn't, you should probably quit.</p>

      <a href="#making-a-lisp-in-c">
        <h1 id="making-a-lisp-in-c">Making a Lisp in C</h1>
      </a>
      <p>
        Today I started working on a lisp in c. I want the lisp to compile to C.
        I've tried it before, but the first time I got stuck on figuring out
        what types things should be (assuming I don't want to fill out all the
        types all the time in lisp). Since then I've done some basic work on
        <a
          href="https://github.com/saikyun/unification/tree/10b19ae798b508127fb54fa68ed218c99bdd23f4"
          >unification</a
        >
        / type inference. When I tried my first lisp in c, I only found research
        papers about unification, which I had trouble understanding. I wasn't
        sure how to learn how to read them either, and ended up listening to
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tractatus_Logico-Philosophicus"
          >Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus</a
        >. It didn't work very well in audiobook form, and it definitely did not
        help me understand how to read science papers with strange symbols.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since then, a friend showed me
        https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2018/unification/ which talked my language
        a lot better. So I was able to do the basic stuff, finally.
      </p>
      <p>
        I did start on
        <a href="https://github.com/saikyun/lisp-to-c">another lisp in c</a>
        after writing that unification stuff. While I did manage to compile some
        C from lisp, I got a bit stuck trying to figure out how enable macros
        (i.e. running lisp while still being in the compilation phase). At least
        I think that's what happened. I started some work on doing both
        <code>eval</code> and <code>compile</code>, i.e. an interpreter
        <em>and</em> a compiler. But it seemed like I would have to write a lot
        of the same code over and over again.
      </p>
      <p>What I've figured out now is that I somehow want to be able to:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Compile lisp code to C</li>
        <li>
          Evaluate lisp code while in the compilation phase, using the same code
          as step 1. does
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        This seemed tricky, since I didn't know of a way to get
        <code>eval</code> for C. Then I remembered that my friend told me about
        <a href="https://bellard.org/tcc/">tcc</a>. tcc is a tiny c compiler,
        that is easy to build and bundle with your project. Even in the 2nd
        iteration, I figured I'd use tcc to generate dlls to facilitate live
        coding. What I didn't realize back then, but figured out now when
        reading the docs, is that you can <em>use tcc as a library</em>, and
        <em>compile functions to memory</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/saikyun/libtcc-example">I tried that.</a>
        It's very awesome. Suddenly you have eval in C.
      </p>
      <p>
        This means that if I encounter a macro during compilation, I can call
        some libtcc functions, and get some results, and then use those results
        when continuing compilation. Pretty cool!
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm also guessing it'll make live coding ever so slightly faster, since
        I won't have to start a separate process, compile a dll/so to disk,
        <code>dlload</code> that dll, e.t.c.
      </p>
      <h2>Third time's the charm</h2>
      <p>
        So now I'm starting again, this time using only C, and trying to make
        sure everything works with tcc. Sadly I had some

        on my macbook air m2, but <code>tcc -run</code> does work. So hopefully
        it can be sorted out.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ofc what I probably &quot;should&quot; do is either use llvm, or go all
        the way and just interact with assembly directly, but both those have
        their problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        First off, llvm just seems to have slower compile times overall than
        tcc. Of course it then wins hugely during runtime, but that's not
        important for <code>eval</code>. My language should be able to AOT
        compile as well, and then I'd use clang / gcc / cl. But when coding, I
        figure tcc will speed up development a lot.
      </p>
      <p>
        Doing something with assembly, instead of having the middle step of C,
        appeals to me a lot, but I know next to nothing about assembly, while I
        can do basic stuff in C. And even if I were to learn some sort of
        assembly, I would be tied hard to whatever platform I decided to learn.
        With tcc it seems feasibly to build/eval on all desktop platforms, and
        maybe the browser and phones.
      </p>
      <p>
        And since my language will build to C in the end, I figure that when
        you're done coding and want to build binaries, it should be possible to
        build them for all manners of platforms, including consoles. You lose
        <code>eval</code>, but while it's a bit boring to lose it, it's not as
        crucial as it is while developing.
      </p>
      <p>
        So far I've built the
        <a href="https://app.slack.com/client/T024SRSB2/C011CD5P1S6"
          >tokenizer</a
        >. Not much to look at yet. But hopefully it won't be too long until I
        can call some C functions using my lisp. :)

      <a href="#coding-with-chatgpt">
        <h1 id="coding-with-chatgpt">Coding with ChatGPT</h1>
      </a>
      <p>
        After I played around with wasm yesterday, I talked to a friend. He got
        me inspired to try some
        <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt">ChatGPT</a> coding. I started
        out making a lisp parser in rust. It turned out pretty well, after some
        massage and asking it to change things. For example, it used
        <code>&amp;str</code> without explicit lifetimes, which Rust didn't
        like. I could tell it to add the explicit lifetimes though, but now the
        code looked disgusting.
      </p>
      <p>
        I bought the premium version and tried gpt4, and it instead used
        <code>String</code> (which seems sensible, and looks a lot nicer), but
        now it did tokenizing and parsing at the same time, which makes the code
        raise my upper lip in disgust.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's a very different feeling from hand coding things. Like pushing a
        river. You can affect it, but it's hard to control, and sometimes you
        get chaotic whirls that the compiler and I don't like.
      </p>
      <p>
        After the lisp parser, &quot;we&quot; made the evaluator. At first it
        had a big <code>match</code> where it would put functions like
        <code>+</code> as a case. But I wanted it instead to look up symbols in
        an environment, and have certain symbols be added to the environment by
        default. I asked it to do this, and it actually rewrote the code. That
        was pretty cool! Still some manual labour on top, but it's the sort of
        change that can feel hard to switch to, when you've already coded in a
        different style.
      </p>
      <p>
        I should mention that from nothing to evaluator took about an hour. I
        think that's faster than I could have written it by hand, and it's
        definitely faster than it would have taken me to write it in Rust, since
        I'm a bit rusty.
      </p>
      <pre><code>cargo run
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.01s
     Running `target/debug/lisp`

Result: 7
</code></pre>
      <p>
        I tried some other stuff, like generating example Clojure code to use as
        a test, something to implement in my own lisp. It was kind of hilarious,
        because it missed a closing parens. Even AI can't write lisp. :')
        <a href="http://danmidwood.com/content/2014/11/21/animated-paredit.html"
          >Paredit</a
        >
        ftw. If you haven't checked out structural programming at all, I
        recommend just looking at those beautiful gifs.
      </p>
      <p>
        One thing ChatGPT has over me is how quickly it can switch between
        different tasks. Despite me feeling tired, I felt that I could get a
        momentum boost by seeing it's code, wether it was correct or not. It's
        like giving me a space where it already has filled out the little calls
        that I might have forgotten (how did I split a string with a regex in
        Clojure again?). It was also nice to get some Rust examples, since I
        haven't used it in 6 years.
      </p>
      <p>
        After that, I tried making a card game using TypeScript. I started out
        having it give me examples using canvas (e.g. a function that renders
        playing cards), but I quickly felt that I wanted some abstractions over
        loading sprites and handling user input. Maybe that was wrong, but that
        was how I felt.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is where I felt chatgpt became very annoying to use. I tried to
        have it give me examples for using PixiJS, then Phaser, then P5. And
        over and over again it resulted in strange typescript errors. I'm sure
        there might have been configuration somewhere that's strange, or I was
        using old examples or something. But overall it felt really unpleasant,
        and took way too much time. It might have more to do with the TypeScript
        + npm + webpack/parceljl/??? combination that easily leads to a silly
        amount of things that can go wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
        After getting over the hurdle of getting something to draw a rectangle
        on the screen (which ended up being easiest with p5), &quot;we&quot;
        started adding things like a deck, hands of cards, a play zone etc. It
        felt all right, but I felt a lot less helped than when it wrote the
        parser. My guess is that the parser is more well defined, and it's the
        sort of thing that's easy to get wrong as a human, while coding game
        mechanics has more to do with positioning things on the screen and
        moving things between different collections.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another point for ChatGPT was asking for math with natural language:
      </p>
      <pre><code>Can you give me an easing function in javascript, that starts out slow, then fast, then slow in the middle, then fast again?
</code></pre>
      <pre><code>Yes, you can use the &quot;easeInOutQuad&quot; easing function in JavaScript to achieve the desired effect. Here is the code for the function:

function easeInOutQuad(t, b, c, d) {
  t /= d/2;
  if (t &lt; 1) return c/2*t*t + b;
  t--;
  return -c/2 * (t*(t-2) - 1) + b;
}
</code></pre>
      <p>
        This is the sort of code I could figure out, but it takes me a long time
        and I don't enjoy it. I believe asking it for help with vector math can
        come in handy as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        The most important thing I learned, is that I enjoy coding a lot more
        than doing code reviews. So I'll probably keep hand coding for as long
        as I can. :)

      <a href="#web-assembly">

      </a>
      <p>
        Yesterday I posted my first blog on
        <a href="http://kodsnack.se">Kodsnack</a>'s slack channel, and got some
        feedback on my woes about programming.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some said that zig and r*** might be good languages to look at, and I
        argued a bit about how they appear to me as languages that doesn't have
        the same goals in mind as me. I think being able to (compile and)
        execute code with &lt;200ms delay is important, since I find it pleasant
        when working on things like animations and layouts. Needing to wait even
        a second while modifying an animation feels painful to me.
      </p>
      <p>
        I want to be clear and say that I do think zig and rust are interesting
        (and probably good) languages, and it's a difference in priorities and
        aesthetics, not in some objective &quot;good&quot;ness. So if you do
        enjoy zig / rust, please keep rocking on. :)
      </p>
      <p>
        I also got some kind words about
        <a href="https://github.com/saikyun/freja">Freja</a>, which I really
        appreciate.
      </p>
      <p>
        The last thing that came up was the subject of WASM. Being interested in
        both web and games, I've been curious about WASM since it's inception. I
        still remember playing some Quake or DOOM demo in the browser, and it
        seemed kind of magical. I never did anything with it though, since at
        the time I was busy writing web apps in node and play League of Legends.
      </p>
      <p>
        Last summer I started wondering if assembly is a good target for live
        coding, since it's very flexible (just swap out the byte code right?).
        It seemed very tricky to write a multi platform compiler though.
      </p>
      <p>
        When camping with my family, I started reading about
        <a href="https://100r.co/site/uxn.html">uxn</a>, and
        <a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/paper_computing.html"
          >pen &amp; paper computing</a
        >).
      </p>
      <p>
        In the paper prototyping site, they mention that you can compute using a
        really small instruction set:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          The following three counter machine models have the same computational
          power since the instructions of one model can be derived from those of
          another:
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>INC(r), DEC(r), JZ(r, z) - Minsky (1961, 1967), Lambek (1961)</p>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>CLR(r), INC(r), JE(rj, rk, z) - Ershov (1958), Peter (1958)</p>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          INC(r), CPY(rj, rk), JE(rj, rk, z) - Elgot-Robinson (1964), Minsky
          (1967)
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        With this knowledge, I made a assembly editor and interpreter using
        termux. It was pretty fun, and it really fulfilled the minimalist
        language that I envisioned. It was pretty cool that you see how the
        registers changed when you ran the program too.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next step was obviously to make this compile to arm assembly. Arm is the
        simple one, right?
        <a
          href="https://developer.arm.com/documentation/dui0068/b/ARM-Instruction-Reference"
          >Oh boy</a
        >. I read a bit, and felt that I understand some, but it was far from my
        naive 3-instruction view of the world. And even if I understood enough,
        I realized I'd be super platform dependent, which doesn't feel very
        appealing.
      </p>
      <p>I haven't touched or thought very much about assembly since then.</p>
      <h2>Back to WASM</h2>
      <p>
        With this in mind, the mention of
        <a href="https://webassembly.org">web assembly</a> came at an
        interesting time for me. I now knew that assembly computing could be
        pretty enjoyable, and I also had built up a need for a simple way to
        play around with assembly, but that was more flexible than uxn. While I
        think uxn is cool, I'm not sure I want the restrictions.
      </p>
      <p>
        WASM seems pretty diverse to me, with a bunch of different projects
        going on. For my goals, this combination appealed to me:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime">wasmtime</a> --
          wasm runtime for desktops
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt">wabt</a> -- tons of
          tools, including wat2wasm: compile wasm text files (.wat) to binary
          (.wasm)
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://wasi.dev">wasi</a> -- system interface for WASM
          (think libc)
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://github.com/bjorn3/browser_wasi_shim"
            >browser_wasi_shim</a
          >
          -- wasi interface for browser
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I've just started (like 2 hours ago), but so far I managed to create a
        little example repo that I feel happy about. Check it out
        <a href="https://github.com/saikyun/wasm-wasi-hello-world">here</a>.
      </p>
      <pre><code>wasmtime hello-world-wasi.wat
hello world
</code></pre>
      <p>
        What I did was pull together examples from the projects mentioned above,
        and managed to run a program printing <code>hello world</code> in both
        the browser and on my macbook, using wasmtime. It's not much, but it's
        still cool to be able to hand write assembly code and have it do stuff
        and run on multiple platforms. :)

      <a href="#thought-loops">
        <h1 id="thought-loops">Thought loops</h1>
      </a>
      <p>
        Inspired by <a href="https://bjoreman.com">Fredrik Björeman</a> I
        decided to create my own blog. In his podcast
        <a href="https://kodsnack.se/508/">Kodsnack</a> he and
        <a href="https://6510.nu/@krig">Kristoffer</a> talks about getting stuff
        out without thinking too much.
      </p>
      <p>
        I felt this very hard, as I've been stuck in some thought loops lately.
        If I were to describe it as shortly as I could, this would be my
        attempt:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            I want to be able to create graphical applications and games, that
            can run on as many platforms as possible, with live coding
            capabilities
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            To fulfill this, I created
            <a href="http://github.com/saikyun/freja">Freja</a>, a code editor
            that can be modified withing itself, and therefore create GUIs and
            games without ever closing the applications
          </p>
          <p>
            2.1. Well, that was the idea anyway, but I still have problems like
            ending up in an infinite loop and needing to restart
          </p>
          <p>
            2.2. The bigger issue however, is that the GUI lib I wrote doesn't
            work well enough. Tons of tiny bugs that pop up whenever I try to
            create new GUI
          </p>
          <p>
            2.3. I also don't quite agree with the language I use,
            <a href="https://janet-lang.org">Janet</a>, which is a super cozy
            lisp, but has some other ideas about live coding / redefining
            functions during runtime, which are not hopeless to overcome, but
            often a bit in the way. This is in no way the fault of the language,
            it just has slightly different goals than I have.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Despair</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            I've tried Unity and Godot, and while I dislike the former
            (extremely sluggish, and the minor point that C# feels like a nice,
            safe car but sooo boring -- where is my meta programming!?), I can
            withstand the latter. It's snappy and nice, has basic hot reload,
            but I personally feel the OOPiness (specifically no interfaces and
            tons of inheritance) makes for a less cozy environment for me.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Now I'm standing here, wondering what to do with my situation. I
            feel like I don't have a cozy place to code, but I'm not sure I'm
            ready to rewrite the GUI library. I'm also thinking about writing it
            in C, a language which I've gotten a lot more love for, since
            learning that hot reloading DLLs is surprisingly viable. But C lacks
            some things I want (multiple dispatch, dynamic arrays). I've tried
            to remedy this with macros, but it still feels a bit icky. Like I'm
            trying to make the language be something it's not.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        So here I am. I've experimented a lot, e.g. making C more dynamic
        (changing structs during runtime), compiling lisp to C, playing around
        with type unification. But I have no clue where to go.
